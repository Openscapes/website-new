Sponsored in part and coordinated by NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center ([NWFSC](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center)).\n\n**Website and participating teams:**\n\n- <https://openscapes.github.io/2021-noaa-nmfs>\n\n**Related blog posts**: \n\n- [Strengthening scientific workflow and team collaboration at NOAA Fisheries](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2021/11/12/noaa-nmfs-champions/)\n\n## Program overview\n\n**This is a professional development and leadership opportunity for NOAA research groups to explore open data science practices.**\n\n**[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org)** is an approach for doing better science in less time[^1]. We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapesâ€™ mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science[^2], enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact. \n\n**[Openscapes Champions](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/)** is a remote-by-design mentorship program for environmental and Earth science research teams to explore open data science practices. Participants attend as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/Python, GitHub, metadata), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture. \n\n**This opportunity is funded in part and coordinated by NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center ([NWFSC](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center)).**\n\n<br>\n\n![](NOAA_logo.png){width=\"40%\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n## Cohort details\n\n**Our NMFS Cohort will meet four times over two months, on alternating Fridays.**\n\n* **Dates:** Sep 17, Oct 1, Oct 15, Oct 29, 2021\n* **Times:** 11:00-12:30 pm PST \n* **Where:** remotely, via Zoom\n* **Who:** Cohort of 7 NOAA research groups. Each team consists of a team lead (PI, project lead, etc) and up to 4 team members of your choice (analysts, technicians, students, postdocs, etc). \n* **Cost:** This opportunity is sponsored by NWFSC and other NOAA offices.\n* **Expected time commitment:** The minimum expected time commitment is 6hrs/month for 2 months. This includes 3 hours/month over Zoom as a full Champions Cohort, as well as teams meeting independently to further discuss topics between Cohort Calls.\n\n## Nominate your team to participate\n\nNominate your team by filling out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/ukhkoMzLXGdQXqtg7) by August 20, 2021. This opportunity is open only to those affiliated with NOAA NMFS. Please submit one nomination per team, preferably by the team lead (PI, project lead, etc). We will confirm participation by late August 2021. \n\nLearn more about the [Openscapes Champions Program](https://openscapes.org/champions) and [FAQs about forming your team](https://openscapes.org/faq).
