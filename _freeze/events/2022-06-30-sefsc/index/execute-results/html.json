We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapes’ mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science[^2], enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact. \n\n**[Openscapes Champions](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/)** is a remote-by-design mentorship program for environmental and Earth science research teams to explore open data science practices. Participants attend as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/Python, GitHub, metadata), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture. \n\n**This opportunity is funded and coordinated by NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center ([SEFSC](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/southeast-fisheries-science-center)).**\n\nIt is the 6th cohort with NOAA Fisheries, and builds from a 2021 cohort that had research teams across four Science Centers: Northwest, Northeast, Southeast, Alaska that was sponsored in part and coordinated by NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center ([NWFSC](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center)).\n\n**Related blog posts**: \n\n- [Strengthening scientific workflow and team collaboration at NOAA Fisheries](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2021/11/12/noaa-nmfs-champions/)\n- [A supportive forum for continued learning and collaboration at NOAA Fisheries Alaska](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2022/04/07/afsc-supportive-forum/)\n\n<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" preview='true'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](NOAA_logo.png){fig-align='center' width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Cohort details\n\n**Our NMFS Cohort will meet five times over two months, on alternating Thursdays.**\n\n* **Dates:** June 30, Jul 14, 28, Aug 11, 25, 2022\n* **Times:** 1:00-2:30 pm ET \n* **Where:** remotely, via Zoom\n* **Who:** Cohort of ~7 NOAA teams. We generally recommend teams of 5, although team size, composition, and extent of shared projects can vary. There are no technical requirements to participate; we expect teams to have a range of skills and responsibilities and an interest in improving shared workflows. \n* **Expected time commitment:** The minimum expected time commitment is 6hrs/month for 2 months. This includes 3 hours/month over Zoom as a full Champions Cohort, as well as teams meeting independently to further discuss topics between Cohort Calls.\n\n<!---\n## Nominate your team to participate\n\nNominate your team by filling out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/ukhkoMzLXGdQXqtg7) by August 20, 2021. This opportunity is open only to those affiliated with NOAA NMFS. Please submit one nomination per team, preferably by the team lead (PI, project lead, etc). We will confirm participation by late August 2021. \n\n--->\n\nLearn more about the [Openscapes Champions Program](https://openscapes.org/champions) and [FAQs about forming your team](https://openscapes.org/faq).
