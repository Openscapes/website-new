Sign up to attend** and get the Zoom link on the Carpentries [Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-sessions-2023) under Community Discussion Session, Exploring collaborations.\n\n[**The Carpentries**](https://carpentries.org/) supports building capacity within organisations interested in teaching data science and coding skills to researchers. In turn, these organisations spread our mission and provide opportunities for collaboration across communities sharing common interests and values.\n\nIn this Community Discussion Session, connect with staff from [NASA Earth Science](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science), [NASA DEVELOP](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/capacity-building/develop) and [NASA Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io) to learn how these organisations are currently engaging with The Carpentries, through workshops for coding skills and Instructor Training to bring teaching philosophies and leadership skills to new places to create new materials. We will explore how they, and like organisations, can work to build successful collaborations to support advancing open science practices.\n\n**We hope this session will begin to build a subcommunity of Carpentries Instructors connected through NASA TOPS, DEVELOP and NASA Openscapes**. However, anyone interested in developing an engaged network of Instructors is welcome to attend.\n\nThis session will include panelists giving a brief overview of how they have been connecting with The Carpentries and a facilitated discussion.\n\nSpeakers: \n\n-   [Chris Battisto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisbattisto/), NASA Openscapes & GES DISC (Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information and Services Center)\n-   [Sean McCartney](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/sean.mccartney), NASA DEVELOP\n-   [Katherine Blanchette](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherine-blanchette-9070b17), NASA TOPS\n-   [Alycia Crall](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/07/introducing-the-carpentries-director-of-community/), Carpentries\n-   [Elizabeth Joyner](https://science.larc.nasa.gov/people/elizabeth-joyner/), NASA Science Directorate\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" preview='true'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](nasa-openscapes-carpentries.png){fig-align='center' width=40%}\n:::\n:::\n",
