Welcome!\n:::\n\n<br> \n\n## CHAMPIONS PROGRAM\n\n**Openscapes Champions is an open data science mentorship program for science teams.** It is a multi-month program that is designed to ignite incremental and sustainable change within research teams and beyond. It helps teams get their own work done, while building skills and community within the realities of scientists' busy schedules, varying expertise and needs.\n\nThis is our flagship program, and from 2019-2024 we have led 20 cohorts. We work with partners to coordinate cohorts of 5 to 7 research teams. \n\n::: {.yellow-box}\n::: {.medium-body-text .center-text}\n{{< fa book-open title=\"An open book\" >}} Champions Program Resources <!-- Openscapes Champions Lesson Series -->\n:::\n::: {.center-text}\nThe [**Openscapes Champions Lesson Series**](https://openscapes.github.io/series) is our open source curriculum we use to teach Champions Cohorts, and you can use it too.\n\nThe Lessons Series also has details about the overall program, and what to expect.

We approach this work as movement building, using the concept where transformations occur from relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel that builds momentum over time.\n\nWe began in 2021, co-led by Erin Robinson of Metadata Game Changers. We are currently working with Mentors from 11 of the 12 NASA Earth science data centers.\n\n::: {.yellow-box}\n::: {.medium-body-text .center-text}\n{{< fa book-open title=\"An open book\" >}} NASA Openscapes Resources <!-- NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook -->\n:::\n::: {.center-text}\n\nThe [**NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook**](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/) is a collection of common tutorials co-created and co-taught by NASA Openscapes Mentors, and it is an open source curriculum you can use too!\n\nLearn more on the [**NASA Openscapes website**](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/), and read about the experiences of our past and current NASA Openscapes work on our [**blog**](blog.qmd#category=nasa-framework).\n:::\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/logo/nasa-openscapes.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='The NASA \\'meatball\\' logo that is blue, red, and white next to an orange Openscapes logo.' width=18%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## NMFS OPENSCAPES\n\n**NMFS Openscapes is a 3-year effort to develop a mentor community across NOAA Fisheries science centers and offices to support NOAA Fisheries’ data, infrastructure, and workforce modernization as part of the Biden-Harris Administration's Inflation Reduction Act**. We approach this work as movement building, using the concept where transformations occur from relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel that builds momentum over time.\n\nThis work is co-led by Eli Holmes, Open Science Lead at NOAA Fisheries, also known as the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS).\n\n::: {.yellow-box}\n::: {.medium-body-text .center-text}\n{{< fa book-open title=\"An open book\" >}} NOAA Fisheries Openscapes Resources \n:::\n::: {.center-text}\n\nThe [**NMFS OpenSci Resource Book**](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/ResourceBook/) is a compilation of resources and experience to support open Science communities in NOAA Fisheries, and it is an open source curriculum you can use too!\n\nLearn more on the [**NMFS Openscapes website**](nmfs-openscapes.github.io/), and read about the experiences of our past and current NMFS Openscapes work on our [**blog**](blog.qmd#category=noaa-fisheries).\n:::\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/logo/nmfs-openscapes.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='The NOAA Fisheries blue logo next to the Openscapes logo.' width=18%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## MENTORS FRAMEWORK\n\n**The Mentors Framework is a multi-year engine for culture change within organizations.** It blends tech and community building through mentoring, coaching, facilitating, art, open source, environment, inclusion, movements, and leaders we admire.\n\n<!---The Framework involves connecting open leaders with each other and leadership and includes regular peer-learning meetings and formal skillbuilding in teaching and coaching. --->\n\nWe began developing the Mentors Framework in 2021 through NASA Openscapes, describing this in [Robinson & Lowndes 2022](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/4560/). We have also been growing the Mentors Framework with NOAA Fisheries, the California Water Boards, and Pathways to Open Science teams and are excited to expand what we are learning with other groups.\n\n\n::: {.yellow-box}\n::: {.medium-body-text .center-text}\n{{< fa book-open title=\"An open book\" >}} Mentors Framework Resources <!-- Mentors Framework Open Source Resources -->\n:::\n::: {.center-text}\nLearn more about the teams who have adopted the Mentors Framework and explore their open work and books:\n\n[**NASA Openscapes**](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/) | [Earthdata Cloud Cookbook](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/) | [blog posts](blog.qmd#category=nasa-framework)  \n\n\n[**NOAA Fisheries Openscapes**](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/) | [Resource Book](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/ResourceBook/) | [blog posts](blog.qmd#category=noaa-fisheries)  \n\n[**California Water Boards Openscapes**](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/swrcb-openscapes/) | [blog post](blog/2022-12-02-swrcb-2022/index.qmd)\n\n[**Blog: How coaching skills have made us better open data science mentors**](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2023/05/17/mentor-coach/)\n\n:::\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/minis/horst_openscapes_desert_cactus.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='A green Saguaro cactus with two arms.' width=5%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## PATHWAYS TO OPEN SCIENCE PROGRAM\n\n**Pathways to Open Science is an event series for Black environmental & marine researchers.** It is led by [Ileana Fenwick](team.qmd) of Openscapes in partnership with [Black in Marine Science (BIMS)](https://www.blackinmarinescience.org/) and [Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science (BWEEMS)](https://www.bweems.org/), focused on building community for the future of data-intensive science.\n\nWe launched this program in 2023 and plan to lead it annually in January-March.\n\n::: {.yellow-box}\n::: {.medium-body-text .center-text}\n{{< fa book-open title=\"An open book\" >}} Pathways to Open Science Program Resources <!-- Pathways to Open Science Program Open Source Resources -->\n:::\n::: {.center-text}\nLearn more on the [**Pathways to Open Science Program webpage**](https://openscapes.github.io/pathways-to-open-science/), and read about experiences on our [**blog**](blog.qmd##category=pathways).\n:::\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/minis/horst_openscapes_desert_roadrunner.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='A brown road runner running to the left.' width=13%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## REFLECTIONS PROGRAM\n\n**Openscapes Reflections is an open data science coaching program for researchers and those who support research.** We know many like you have been looking for a lighter-weight way to get involved or continue building habits to support yourself and your colleagues. We’ve designed the Reflections Program to meet this need; Reflections is a 3-week program modeled from leadership coaching, something now core to the Openscapes approach.\n\nWe launched this program in 2023 and plan to lead it annually in May!\n\n::: {.yellow-box}\n::: {.medium-body-text .center-text}\n{{< fa book-open title=\"An open book\" >}} Reflections Program Resources<!-- Booklet -->\n:::\n::: {.center-text}\nLearn more and register in the [**Openscapes Reflections Booklet**](https://openscapes.github.io/booklet/), which introduces prompts to guide your reflections.\n:::\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/minis/horst_openscapes_desert_tortoise.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='A brown tortoise.' width=13%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n:::",
