<p><em>We are halfway through the <a href="https://openscapes.org/">Openscapes</a> Champions program, which mentors scientists and empowers them and their labs with data science and open practices and helps grow the community of practice within the lab and beyond. This week we are meeting for a <a href="https://openscapes.github.io/summit2019/">summit</a> supported by my <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a> Fellowship and hosted at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (<a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/">NCEAS</a>) to strengthen relationships, share lessons learned, problem solve, and ignite new collaborations. This is a closer look at the the work of these inspiring scientists.</em></p>

<p>At Openscapes, we champion open practices in environmental science to help uncover data-driven solutions faster. Through the Champions Program, we do this by mentoring scientists and empowering them with open data science so that they can do better science in less time and champion these practices in their communities. This means working directly with scientists on the ground and in the lab to understand their challenges and help them find solutions to their data workflows and create real change and work within their already packed schedules.</p>
<p>Although environmental research is based on collecting, combining, analyzing complex data from multiple sources, most environmental scientists have not had formal computing and data training. Through Openscapes, Champions are learning alongside their lab members how to incorporate data science and open practices into their work, enabling their lab members, and taking their research to new heights.</p>
<p>Our inaugural cohort of Champions are early career environmental scientists leading critically important research programs and dedicated to teaching the next generation of scientists.</p>
<p><strong>The scientists we work with are at the heart of Openscapes: these are people dedicating their lives to helping find solutions to some of the most complex and ever-changing environmental challenges we face as a society.</strong> We are so thrilled to have them a part of Openscapes and wanted to share with you about them and celebrate their achievements. Here is a brief introduction to each of them, with a specific focus on their recent work since they began the Openscapes program. All labs have been working on Codes of Conduct and having internal “<a href="https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2019/03/10/seaside-chats/">Seaside Chats</a>” to discuss shared data workflows in the lab.</p>

She has also reorganized the online infrastructure and file sharing for her courses to save time in future years, adopted new, reproducible and collaborative file structures for recently launched research projects, and has worked with her lab to develop a long-term vision for reproducibility in their research.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Wood’s lab is launching a new research initiative to understand long-term change in aquatic disease, and she recently published two manuscripts on the value of museum specimens for disease ecology (see <a href="https://chelsealwood.wordpress.com/publications/">full publication list</a>). In March, she gave a department seminar at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and in April she will give the <a href="http://www.eeb.utoronto.ca/news-events/atwoodcolloq.htm">Rising Star in Ecology Lecture</a> at University of Toronto’s Atwood Colloquium. She recently won a Western Regional Aquaculture Center grant to study a <a href="https://chelsealwood.wordpress.com/research/invasive-parasites/">parasite that affects Pacific oysters</a>. Additionally, Dr.&nbsp;Wood teaches graduate students how to study the ecology of past ecosystems rigorously and quantitatively through her <a href="https://chelsealwood.wordpress.com/teaching/fish-511-historical-ecology/">Historical Ecology course</a> at UW’s School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, which includes a <a href="https://twitter.com/DrChelseaLWood/status/1101634767810834432">field trip</a> to the Resource Center at Seattle’s Museum of History and Industry.</p>
