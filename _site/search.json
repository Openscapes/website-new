    "text": "We believe open practices can accelerate data-driven solutions and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapes helps shift culture by mentoring researchers to move from lonely science as they skillbuild and navigate the open science landscape safely with their teams and communities.\nWe call this kinder science for future us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe approach open science as a spectrum, a behavior change, and a movement. There are many ways to practice open science and to welcome others to participate. We share our work openly and share stories, in part through our resources, media, blog, and events. We are influenced and inspired by many leaders and community organizers, particularly in climate and get out the vote movements.\n\n\n\nOur approach for movement building and sustainability is underpinned by our Flywheel (Robinson & Lowndes 2022). The Flywheel concept was developed by Jim Collins in the book Good to Great. No matter how dramatic the end result, building something to last never happens in one fell swoop. Rather, the process resembles relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel, turn upon turn, building momentum. It is never one big thing, it is many little things reinforced over time. Our Flywheel drives how we work on a daily basis and how we plan for years to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Openscapes Approach Guide\n\n\nThe Openscapes Approach Guide is our “lab manual”, an attempt to codify our approach to onboard ourselves and new team members to how we work. It is an open source resource you can use too.\nCite as: Openscapes Core Team, Butland, Robinson, Lowndes. (2023). Openscapes Approach Guide (v2023.06). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8034313\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapes helps teams transition to inclusive open science workflows. We mentor teams to better tackle their questions by strengthening shared practices, underpinned by existing community-developed tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur our theory of change is that by engaging, empowering, and amplifying research teams with open habits and mindsets for data-intensive science, they become leaders in the open science movement and have more enduring scientific impact while also creating a kinder, more inclusive scientific culture."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We are thrilled to announce that we have been awarded a 3-year grant from NASA!\nTogether with the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California Santa Barbara, University of Washington eScience Institute, Metadata Game Changers, 2i2c, and The Carpentries, we are answering the call from NASA to support researchers from the NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) migrating workflows to the cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\nArticles and cross-postings by our partners\n\nNASA Earth Data — Openscapes: Using “The Force” of Open Science in the Cloud\nMetadata Game Changers\n\n\n\nThe Openscapes Framework is a scalable leadership training and community building framework developed by Openscapes that we will use over three years to support NASA DAAC researchers migrating to the cloud. We designed the Openscapes Framework building off Openscapes’ flagship Champions program, which provides cohort-based open data science mentorship for research teams.\nThe Framework has three components:\nEngage DAAC mentors. Support and strengthen the community of DAAC folks that are already creating cloud learning resources. Through Openscapes mentorship, Carpentries instructor training, and 2i2c cloud services, these DAAC mentors will work together to create learning resources for their teams and communities.\n\nWe are so excited to have five DAACs in this first cohort including the Atmospheric Science Data Center (ASDC), Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services (GES DISC), Land Processing (LP DAAC), National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and Physical Oceanography DAAC (PO.DAAC).\nEach DAAC selected 2-3 mentors, who are already leading the way in helping researchers utilize the Cloud. Our first class of DAAC mentors includes:\n\nMakhan Virdi, ASDC\nVishal Bagadia, ASDC\nMatthew Tisdale, ASDC\nJennifer Adams, GES DISC\nChandana Gangodagamage, GES DISC\nAaron Friesz, LP DAAC\nCole Krehbiel, LP DAAC\nPaul Moth, NSIDC DAAC\nAmy Steiker, NSIDC\nCatalina Oaida, PO.DAAC\nJack McNelis, PO.DAAC\n\n\nEmpower science research teams. Empower NASA research teams using NASA data on the cloud with open data science practices through the Openscapes Champions program. DAAC mentors will also participate to strengthen relationships, identify needs, and test cloud learning resources. Additionally, DAACs will host Carpentries workshops and we will train DAAC mentors as Champions program facilitators.\nAmplify open science leaders. Increase visibility of NASA DAAC mentors and research teams as Cloud champions and strengthen the community of practice around open science at NASA. As participants champion open science and cloud workflows in their own work, we will help amplify through coordinating Community Calls, sharing stories through blogs and social media, and through conferences like the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting.\nThe Openscapes Framework will be repeated and improved each year, with DAAC mentors increasingly taking the lead. We began this project with sustainability in mind: our goal is to co-develop this framework with the DAACs so that they can continue to utilize it to help scientists migrate to the cloud beyond our 3-year award. Through this project, we will also be learning how we might implement the Openscapes Framework with other scientific communities.\n\n\n\nAnother exciting thing about this project is the opportunity to expand our partners!\n\nJulie Lowndes, NCEAS, UC Santa Barbara, is the Principal Investigator for this project and is the founder of Openscapes. She will lead the Champions program, communication efforts, and manage the project.\nAmanda Tan, eScience Institute, University of Washington is a co-Investigator. Amanda has led the development of Carpentries-style training material for NASA data on the cloud through an ESIP Incubator Award. In this project she will support DAAC mentors as they create and implement training material.\nErin Robinson, Metadata Game Changers, will support community engagement as a consultant based on her extensive work in the NASA Earth science data community.\n\nThis project allows us to partner with organizations that share Openscapes’ values of open, reproducible, and inclusive science:\n\n2i2c develops, deploys, customizes, and manages open source tools and cloud services for interactive computing in research and education. They deploy community-driven infrastructure, inspired by use-cases such as the UC Berkeley DataHubs and the Pangeo project, that provides easy “one-click-to-cloud” access with Jupyter Notebooks through the web browser designed to reduce the startup burden for new learners, and this approach will also benefit the NASA DAAC community.\nThe Carpentries teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide. Openscapes is joining The Carpentries through this project as a Silver Member, which includes four Carpentries workshops per year and instructor training opportunities to the NASA DAAC community.\n\n\n\n\nWe are getting these questions a lot, so here is our take.\nNASA Earth Science Data Systems missions collect Earth data, including sea ice, physical oceanography, vegetation and many other parameters – data used by researchers around the world for many different purposes, including answering pressing questions in ecology and environmental science. Further, NASA promotes open science – from the NASA Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) program 2020 Highlights report:\n\nOpen data are the foundation of ESDS efforts to fulfill the program’s vision of accelerating scientific advancement for societal benefit through innovative Earth science data stewardship and technology development…. [This includes a specific goal] to leverage the diversity of global Earth science communities to advance open science.\n\nOpenscapes’ long-term goal is to enable robust, inclusive, and enduring science- and data-driven solutions to global and time-sensitive challenges. We approach open science as a spectrum, as a behavior change, and as a movement. We see data analysis and stewardship as entryways to meet scientists where they are, helping them develop new skill sets and mindsets while empowering them as leaders. With NASA support, the project team and the partners, the Openscapes Framework fundamentally changes the paradigm for supporting research teams and DAAC mentors, first to work more openly with their teams on the cloud, and ultimately to advance open science!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are influenced and inspired by many leaders and community organizers, particularly in climate justice and get out the vote movements. That means, we know this isn’t just about us or an effort we can do alone. We are always looking to learn and build from, with, and for others. Please find us on Twitter @openscapes or join our newsletter."

    "text": "NWFSC cohort setup and structure\nEric Ward, a statistician and quantitative ecologist at NOAA’s NWFSC, saw the value of the Openscapes Champions program following the Northeast Center Cohort coordinated by Scott Large and worked with us to bring the program to scientists at NWFSC. Thirty fisheries scientists signed up for the NWFSC cohort, interested in exploring new approaches to data analysis and stewardship, and connecting with others at NWFSC. Unique to this cohort, participants signed up as individuals and were assigned a team based on which of the four NWFSC divisions they represented; Champions cohorts otherwise are designed for a team lead to sign up their group and participate together with their team members.\n\n\n \n\nTweet announcing the NWFSC Cohort by Eric Ward.\n\n\n\nWe piloted a 2-month version of the Champions program, which we knew would cover half the content of the 4-month version, but were excited to test this as a “kick-start” for participants. This 2-month version had four sessions, or “cohort calls”. We created agendas for the 4 cohort calls by adapting the Openscapes Champions Lesson Series. The full list of lessons we covered during our four cohort calls were:\n\nIntroducing the Openscapes mindset and better science in less time\nData and coding strategies for future us\nOnboarding to collaborative research with GitHub Issues and further details from the Ocean Health Index transition\nPsychological safety and team Pathway presentations\n\n\nThis curriculum had several new and modified lessons compared to previous cohorts. We introduced the Pathways template in Call 1 so that participants could immediately start thinking about where they started in terms of the tools and practices for reproducibility, collaboration, and communication. Over the course of two months, the NWFSC cohort continued to evolve their Pathway, articulating their needs and identifying next steps. One of Eric’s observations was that the Pathways concept fit perfectly into the professional development tools being used at the NWFSC:\n\n\n“As part of the ongoing strategic visioning process, NWFSC staff have been creating individual professional development plans. Much like the Openscapes Pathways template, these individual plans have helped employees identify new opportunities and set short and long term goals.”"

    "text": "Iterating the Champions lesson series\nIn response to questions and feedback in the second call on several participants having similar reproducibility challenges with their collaborators, we created a new lesson for the third call. Here we shared more details about the Ocean Health Index (OHI) transition to open science: what was it like day-to-day switching from a workflow with email attachments to a workflow on GitHub? And how did we decide what to continue to keep in R scripts as we started using RMarkdown more for reproducibility, communication, publishing, and engaging with stakeholders? These stories will likely be introduced in earlier calls in future cohorts as we continue to iterate.\n\n\n \n\nTara Robertson discusses how psychological safety is important for teamwork\n\n\n\nTara Robertson, a diversity, equity, and inclusion consultant working with Openscapes, created and led a new lesson on psychological safety, which is defined by Amy Edmondson as the shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking. We ended with this new lesson because making these technical open science changes we discussed throughout the NWFSC Cohort requires psychological safety, and the NWFSC Champions had begun cultivating this safety within the cohort and are now empowered to take it out into their daily work.\nIncreasingly, the Champions lesson series includes example workflows and stories from previous Champions cohorts, including the 2020 workshop at NOAA NEFSC. For example, Scott Large’s group has continued their Seaside Chats and use GitHub Projects to manage them openly, and Gavin Fay’s group has written a Lab Manual stating their code of conduct and common practices in their group, including protocols for onboarding and offboarding. Additionally, Kimberly Bastille led a 2020 publication for integrated ecosystem assessments (IEA) called Improving the IEA Approach Using Principles of Open Data Science, and is a high-profile example of the importance of open data science in applied research."

    "section": "What did the participants achieve?",
    "text": "What did the participants achieve?\nAt the beginning of this shorter cohort with modified team structure, we had some questions like: Would this shorter 2-month format be valuable for participants to get on a path for more open and collaborative research? Would the loose rather than formal team structure in the NWFSC cohort still allow for connections with others at NWFSC so they can learn together and support each other? The answers were resounding yes! And yes!\nIn the fourth and last call, eleven teams presented their pathways. Each team had something different resonate for their work from the three prior sessions, but everyone had ideas about what they were going to do next. Participants had taken Champions program material back to their larger research groups and discussed it during Seaside Chats, resulting in each team designing a pathway forward that they described to the cohort. One participant shared that it was validating to know that everyone is learning as we go, which was great to hear since a goal of Openscapes to make this learning journey less lonely. Even more, the cohort expressed that they knew that everyone’s varying degrees of technical expertise was okay and that they could use each other as support and pick up additional skills from each other and from other open communities, for example rOpenSci and RLadies Seattle.\nTwo teams identified that they will be integrating Git into their workflows. Many held the sentiment expressed by one participant, “There is an upfront time-commitment that provides long-term benefits in terms of product accessibility for both users and developers.” Further, they said that the value is clearer in investing in the upfront time commitment. From Eric:\n\n\n“Data and code stored in email have a tendency to get lost, particularly when staff retire. Openscapes helped us understand the value of using version control, and tools like Github – both to preserve data, and archive changes. In the week after the workshops, we’ve created several new repositories for archiving work for long running projects. Thanks so much!”"

    "text": "What did Openscapes learn?\nRegarding the team structure, we do still value the formal team structure where the PI or group supervisor attends with their team. We value team leads participating as part of an effort to change the culture through learning together — and as an endorsement of staff taking time and effort to transition towards open science tools and practices. In session 4 we were surprised at the number of smaller teams that existed within this cohort and in the survey, there was a request to spend some breakouts working together as a team. We were inspired as the cohort realized that across teams and divisions, that they could collectively affect change across NWSFC by collectively advocating for open science.\nIt turned out that in 2 months they learned a lot and achieved a lot with these first starting steps. We will follow-up with this cohort in 3 months to check-in and provide a bit more support and accountability to see how they are progressing on their pathways and what’s changed since this session. We were also so grateful to work with this cohort with Sean Kross, who is a UCSD PhD student studying human computer interaction, and Tara Robertson, who’s work with Openscapes is supported by Code for Science and Society (CS&S) to help us increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in Openscapes events.\nWe are so proud of the work the NWFSC cohort did and are looking forward to seeing how NOAA NWSFC continues to move toward open science. We hope that their leadership will inspire the broader scientific community through visible examples and leadership at NWSFC.\nThank you Eric and all the NWFSC Champions!\n\n\n \n\nTweet by Eric Ward at the conclusion of the NWFSC Cohort"

    "text": "At the ESIP Winter Meeting, “Data for All People: From Data Generation to Data Use and Understanding”, we held a session called “Better Science for Future Us: Planning for the Year of Open Science”, with speakers from University of North Carolina (UNC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries, California Water Boards, University of Colorado, and United States Geological Survey (USGS). The goals of this session were to increase visibility and value of open science within government and support researchers and leaders that are already doing this within government organizations; to create more channels for inter- and cross-agency learning; and to share open science stories across agencies as we prepare for NASA’s Year of Open Science initiative. Speakers shared stories about open science in government and their experiences with Openscapes. These examples were shared in a “Fishbowl” format, where speakers each shared and then there was a broader discussion with the 70+ participants.\nQuick links:"

    "text": "3 takeaways for planning for the year of open science\nOur ESIP session provided space to bring four different groups together who are working with Openscapes so that they could share their stories and discuss their implementation of open science practices with a broader audience of allies. These folks are “early adopters” who are investing the time and effort needed to help colleagues transition to open science. This session aimed to increase the visibility of open science within government, support open science leaders within government organizations, and create more channels for inter- and cross-agency learning.\nA strong theme throughout the whole session was equity. Ileana Fenwick underscored how open science has not been accessible to everyone in science and discussed her ongoing work to build equitable pathways for researchers at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and the importance of providing support and aftercare. Eli Holmes described how equity must become a focus within NOAA as well; while some science centers have had a high density of early adopters and lots of resources including code sharing and peer mentors, other centers or labs have had fewer early adopters or their coders have not been connected to the others. Anna Holder’s work at the California Water Boards centers equity. Anna sees the true spirit of open science as being at the nexus of open data and science; effective science communication; and equity, specifically centered around racial equity and environmental justice.\nHere are 3 overlapping takeaways from this session that all speakers embodied. We describe these more fully below.\n\nBoth top-down and grassroots efforts are necessary\nDissolve silos by supporting early adopters\nReuse and build from existing efforts to accelerate change"

    "text": "Both top-down and grassroots efforts are necessary\nBoth top-down and grassroots efforts supporting open science are necessary - and need open and active communication channels. Our session started off framing NASA-Openscapes as “top-down” since NASA’s Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) leadership supports open science through official policy and initiatives (see the 2021 NASA ESDS Program Highlights), and framing efforts at NOAA Fisheries as “grassroots” as early adopter researchers find each other and join forces to make the case for open science to leadership.\nBut as we talked, the importance of and need for both really came through.\nWhen Amy Steiker and Aaron Friesz, from NASA’s Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs), discussed their work with NASA Openscapes, Amy mentioned that while there is critical top-down support from NASA leadership, managers look to researchers at the grassroots level to determine what open science can look like. Additionally, NASA staff have been asking for open source tooling and workflows to support researchers, including JupyterHubs where they can develop open source code on the Cloud. Now as Aaron, Amy, and colleagues have access to a JupyterHub to develop and teach tutorials for NASA Earthdata (like they did at the 2021 Cloud Hackathon), they are able to share progress and lessons learned, and get feedback and support from their NASA teams, managers, and leadership. So, while from the outside this might look strictly top-down, NASA is a really exciting example of how both are needed and how creating channels for them to listen and iterate together is really key."

    "section": "Dissolve silos by supporting early adopters",
    "text": "Dissolve silos by supporting early adopters\nSilos within organizations can be dissolved by supporting early adopters that already exist. Eli Holmes introduced open science early adopters as part of the diffusion of innovation theory, that there is a predictable progression of stages as an idea diffuses through a population or organization (see image below). Early adopters play a critical role in not only uptake of new ideas and technologies like open science, but also in championing and communicating the vision of what is possible to reach leadership, who are part of the majority and key to organization-wide decision making, policies, and culture. She described the spread of open science and open source workflows at NOAA Fisheries and how early adopters do exist but tend to be siloed and can have trouble finding each other - in part due to lack of communication channels like email lists or cross-program technical groups. In a grassroots fashion, Eli and colleagues have created the NOAA Fisheries Openscapes GitHub organization as a place to share analytical and teaching resources for scientists across the agency, support open science communities such as the agency R User Group and RStudio Connect community, and build visibility for open science work already going on at NOAA Fisheries.\n\n\n \n\n\nSlides from Eli Holmes’ presentation showing the diffusion of innovation theory and that early adopters can be isolated.\nAnna Holder said of the California Water Boards, “like many complex organizations, we too have complex data systems and infrastructure”. She described their open data journey and how this has been part of their organizational fabric for over five years. In addition to official strategies, communication and teaching with different audiences within the organization has been key. Anna and colleagues are leading “data literacy” workshops for executives — not to teach tools like R and GitHub but to discuss that these tools exist and showing use cases that make their staff more efficient, for example where data quality control can be done in minutes rather than weeks. This work often involves “slowing down in order to speed up”, and underscores not only the importance of early adopters but the role early adopters play in teaching and supporting colleagues as whole organizations transition to open science.\n\n\n \n\n\nSlide from Anna Holder’s presentation showing the California Water Boards’ open data journey\nIt is critical to recognize that early adopters already exist. They are bright spots that get brighter when working together and collectively spread more brightness within an organization, like Anna’s work at the Water Boards, Eli’s work at NOAA Fisheries, Aaron and Amy’s work within NASA, or Ileana’s cross- organization work with HBCUs. This follows the point above that grassroots efforts are critical for building these communities and helping identify needs."

    "section": "Reuse and build from existing efforts to accelerate change",
    "text": "Reuse and build from existing efforts to accelerate change\nWhy is the Openscapes approach working? There have been many preceding and ongoing efforts, so what’s different here? This came up several times in the session live notes and we did not have much time to discuss, so we debriefed with the speakers and NASA Openscapes Mentors afterwards and have some emerging thoughts to share. We are all building off years of work by many in the open science community and beyond and are so grateful for those ongoing efforts.\nA critical part is creating “space and place”. One of the key things that we do is to create space for cohorts of researchers and mentors to talk, build community, and find common needs (which also takes time and consistency).  Then a place is needed to collaborate, which means using technology like Google Docs, GitHub, Slack, as well as JupyterHubs, and RStudio, depending on community norms. For the NASA Openscapes Cohort, having our 2i2c JupyterHub has been really critical; for many it has been their first exposure to the Cloud, and since they now have hands-on experience they can better support researchers who are using it too. In Ileana, Eli, and Anna’s work in marine and aquatic science, RStudio is a shared environment to work together because shared workflows, for example with RMarkdown, enable shared approaches to communicate with different audiences.\nAnother part is that we can reuse and build from what already works. Aaron Friesz described the benefit of being able to “peer over the wall” to see and compare what types of strategies and resources other NASA DAACs have explored. This then enables Mentors and their colleagues at other NASA data centers to incorporate and reuse what was working elsewhere, rather than all reinventing in their own silos. This can mean reusing code as well as reusing communication channel setup for different communities; for example several data centers are re-using the 2021 Cloud Hackathon book structure and facilitation as well as the lessons in upcoming workshops. There is so much previous, ongoing, and accelerating work that has been developed as part of the open movement that we can leverage — meaning technology, material, and the ability to work together. \nFinally, a large part is the time investment, i.e. having time for open science as part of paid jobs. Creating “space and place” takes time. It is really important to recognize that all speakers have been given time, resources, and support by their supervisors. This has been particularly important for NASA Openscapes, where Managers at the DAACs have approved dedicating up to 80% of weekly time to open science to support learning through Carpentries Instructor Training and Openscapes Cohort Calls; Co-Working, and Clinics; developing, reviewing, and getting teaching feedback in “dry runs”; and teaching at Cloud Hackathons and workshops (see NASA Cloud tutorials)."

Artwork by Allison Horst.\n\n\n\nOver the last two months I participated in the Openscapes Champions: NOAA Southwest & Pacific Islands Fisheries Fall 2022 Cohort. Openscapes encompasses the Open Science movement, which includes making your research and the scientific process more accessible, reproducible, and collaborative. Before starting this workshop, the Southwest Acoustic Ecology Lab (SAEL) already incorporated the Open Science culture in many aspects of our work, but the Openscapes framework gave us the opportunity to build some Open Science habits that we were lacking and started our journey towards a more efficient and collaborative team.\nOver the 2 month program, I participated in a variety of weekly meetings, where I learned about these open data science approaches, developed my teams’ science pathway, and collaborated with other Fisheries scientists. My large cohort focused on the following lessons:\n\nOpenscapes mindset and better science in less time\nGitHub for publishing and project management\nTeam culture and data strategies\nOpen communities and coding strategies\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the Openscapes workshop participants on a weekly Zoom call.\n\n\n\nSmaller co-working meetings created space for me to collaborate with colleagues at other Fisheries science centers. In one of our first co-working sessions, I met with our colleagues at the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center where we shared ideas for using GitHub and other Open Science tools. These conversations gave me insight on how others were using GitHub, as well as how we could move forward with it as our main home for all of our lab documentation.\nSeaside Chats with our SAEL team allowed those of us attending the Openscapes workshop to share our newfound knowledge and experience so we could make our science more open. During these sessions, we streamlined our science pathways, documented our methods through GitHub, and had general team strategy discussions.\nMy favorite tool I was introduced to was Quarto (an open source scientific and technical publishing system). My team and I quickly realized that this was the perfect tool for transferring everything from our messy Google Drives to GitHub! To put this into action, I transferred our recently revamped Adrift Field Methods manual to a Quarto web book. Previously, it was sitting in a google drive where it wasn’t easy to find and had accessibility issues. In just a couple hours, I was able to easily make a new repository, copy a Quarto template, and transfer the google document to a GitHub repository and an easy to navigate website! As we continued to transfer documents from google drives to GitHub, it became easier to find and share things, and the stress associated with file management drastically decreased.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot from our ADRIFT Field Methods website created through the Openscapes Program. This is a living document where we can outline our methodology and update/archive specific components of our methods and hardware as changes are made. Credit: NOAA Fisheries / Kourtney Burger\n\n\n\nGoing into this program, our team culture fully embraced the Open Science movement. Openscapes pushed us to dive deeper into specific tools and strategies that will allow our science, methods, and lab culture to live beyond the current members of our team. Moving forward, we will continue to develop our GitHub as a living home for all of our lab manuals, methods, and shared resources.\nOpenscapes gave me a breath of fresh air as I learned that data science shouldn’t be tiresome, and that there are an abundance of resources and communities to help me and my team along our Open Science pathway. This Open Science framework, the tools we learned, and the communities we have developed will allow us to continue to grow as individual scientists and as a team, as we transform our science to be more open, reproducible, and sustainable for years to come."

    "text": "Crossposted at NCEAS\nThe National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) funds Working Groups of 15-20 scientists from across disciplines and sectors to collaborate on environmental synthesis science projects. In this time of pandemic, groups that would typically be meeting in person four times over ~two years are now faced with launching their projects virtually. NCEAS is providing training and support to help those teams kickstart their research collaborations remotely, and Openscapes was heavily involved in designing and leading the two remote learning modules. In this blog we highlight some of the key takeaways and best practices from our second remote support module, delivered to a cohort of four Working Groups that are launching projects this spring.\n\nIn this module, we wanted to empower multi-institutional and cross-sectoral science teams to collaboratively develop reproducible workflows for data-driven projects. The idea was to take remote, decentralized teams and help them to develop a centralized mindset and toolkit for data & code while working remotely. Our goal was to expose participants to “good enough” tools and practices to develop common practices that will enable them to collaborate efficiently among each other, but also with their future selves. We focused on the centralization and management of the information, data and code they will be collecting and developing over their two-year project; stressing that for each part of their workflow, everyone should be encouraged and enabled to contribute no matter their technical skills.\nWe structured this second remote workshop like we did in the first one, which focused on strategies for efficient collaboration. We engaged participants using Zoom and a collaborative Google Doc, enabling active participation through discussions, silent documenting, +1s voting, and breakout groups of 3-4 people for the more hands-on parts of our 3-hour workshop.\n\n\n\n\nDiscussing the different analytical phases of synthesis projects.\n\n\n\nHere are some topics we focused on, based on our experiences of providing data science support to working groups:\n\nVirtual environment to share documents and centralize communication:\n\nWhen choosing your tools, making sure your whole team has access and can use them should be your most important criterion rather than the “best” tool.\nSetting team standards on how to leverage those tools is also key. For example, having a shared drive and linking to a shared document in the email is preferred to sending the document as attachment; this will help centralize the information and limit the number of different versions floating around\nAcknowledge and embrace different “techiness” skills by being flexible and kind, and offering opportunities to teach others\n\n\n\n\nData Management:\n\nMore than 70% of a project will spend manipulating data, plan for this time and support the people doing this.\nPlan in advance for the different phases of your data life cycle: collect, quality check, analyze and preserve (see illustration of the data life cycle)\nThis includes detailing how people “hand off” data and code between steps\nHow you structure your data matters for your analysis – we recommend long format, aka “tidy data”\nSpreadsheets should be set up to streamline data analysis later on (see advice on data organization in spreadsheets)\nLeverage naming convention and file structure to organize your data and make it easier to process in a programmatic way – following advice on naming things\nTrack the provenance of your data in a data log\n\n\n\n\nReproducible analytical workflows:\n\nWhy\n\nEmpower you to iterate quickly and integrate new information\nEnable others to build on your work: Your research is important – but arguably only when other people can find it, make sense of it, and build from it. And those “other people” are most likely to be you in the future!\nYou’re always collaborating: you’re collaborating most importantly with Future You, and also Future Us! Develop workflows in a mindset geared towards collaboration without compartmentalizing\n\nHow\n\nUse scripts and leave copy-pasting behind\nComment your code… too much is not a thing; notebooks like Jupyter and RMarkdown can help you to be more explicit by integrating outputs/results\nKeep things in sync in a centralized place online to avoid duplication (data, scripts, code, …)\nCentralize your data in shared computing resources or data repositories\nPublishing is part of your analytical workflow 💯😎\n\nTools\n\nUse version control software (e.g. git) rather than your own bookkeeping methods (goodbye script_JM_03v5b.R)\nCode sharing (e.g. GitHub)\nPublish and share analysis and results online (e.g. Google Docs, GitHub pages, …)\n\n\n\n\nWorkflows are rarely linear! They are developed iteratively, and one of the most helpful things you can do is talk about them with your research team.\nDuring breakout rooms, participants experienced collaborative version control hands-on by editing text files from the Github web interface. The goal was to showcase that there are a lot of entryways to contribute to analytical workflows (edit a file online, drag and drop to upload, …), which is important because not everyone on a collaborative project needs coding skills but they do need to operate comfortably with their team. Participants worked together in breakout groups, and while we did not know each participant’s experience with GitHub, we made sure to mix career level and gender, instead of randomly assigning groups, aiming to foster echanges and learning among the participants.\nThe task of the hands-on GitHub session was to collaboratively edit a list of the team’s favorite desserts, first on the README of the repository and second using a csv file. Here is an example of the results. Our prompts were:\n\n\n\n\nBreakout group hands-on: Collaborating with GitHub does not require programming skills!\n\n\n\nFrom the feedback we received, participants from the LTER network and SNAPP Partnership had fun collaborating and were impressed by how much you could achieve in a 20min hands-on exercise done in a remote setup. With this workshop, we were able to help remote, decentralized teams develop a more centralized mindset and toolkit for their analytical workflows. For more, here is a blank copy of the full agenda!\nAs part of NCEAS effort to support and improve remote collaboration, we hope to offer this kind of virtual training and support to more groups within and beyond NCEAS; contact Deputy Director, Courtney Scarborough if you are interested in future offerings. And, if you are interested in ongoing support of this kind, check out the resources offered on the NCEAS Learning Hub, including the Openscapes remote mentorship program."

Here, I’ve focused on:\n\ndescribing the operations of the program (modeled after Mozilla Open Leaders)\ndescribing the content of what we’re teaching (modeled after Lowndes et al. 2017)\ngiving an update of how it is going so far since launching earlier in January (one month in)\n\n\n\n“Champions” are early career environmental researchers in leadership roles – for example: faculty, lecturers, and program managers. Recognizing that early career scientific leaders a) often had no formal computing or data training b) do not have time to learn All Of The Things c) need ways to manage all the data and analyses within their labs in way that also streamlines onboarding and offboarding lab members, the program’s aim is to provide guidance, paths, community, and agency for Champions and their labs to incrementally engage.\nOpenscapes Champions is a five-month mentorship program that is led remotely. Each month, there is individual mentorship for each Champion, and two “Cohort Calls” where we convene all Champions together, along with their lab members. Throughout, all participants learn about open practices and data science; strategize how to engage; meet other labs; set, review, and meet goals; and stay accountable. For each 1.5-hour Cohort Call, I teach for a maximum of 40 minutes, so that we spend most time discussing these topics in the context of their labs.\nSo how do you lead a remote program like this? You model it after Mozilla Open Leaders, which has developed a great program that they have repeatedly tested and improved over seven rounds. It takes intense coordination, deliberate focus on creating a positive and inclusive culture, design to make calls engaging and interactive, Zoom, and Google Docs. (I think this is really cool how the intentions of the program are realized with the software tools available — you will see this as a theme throughout). I will focus on the software here, and have a whole separate upcoming post on culture.\n\n\nParticipants all join Cohort Calls through Zoom, a video conferencing software that we use to interact in real time and also record the whole call as an archived resource for participants. In addition to accommodating large groups for discussions, it also has a great breakout room feature. Breakout rooms allows all participants to not only listen to lessons and discuss as a full group, but also lets them break into small groups to discuss topics. Following breakout groups, participants rejoin and summarize to the group both verbally and in writing, using Google Docs.\nEach call has an agenda written as a Google Doc to enable real-time participation. During the call, all participants have the agenda open, and follow along, writing their thoughts in specific places and participating in active shared note-taking. This is an example pre-call agenda. Following the real-time writing and engagement during the Cohort Call, the agenda serves as a record of the discussions had that participants can revisit and anyone who missed can review.\n\n\n\nThe program architecture (both conceptually and physically with software, agendas, and planning) that Mozilla has developed is repeatable and scalable to serve future cohorts – as well as different disciplines and communities. The way the program can grow is clever: the coordination and content can be led by a small team that welcomes others from the open community to donate 1-2 hours of time per month to provide individual mentorship. This makes it possible to support more participants: the program could not scale if it required that I provide individual mentorship for all Champions; I could not support more than 7-10 Champions at a time. Mozilla Open Leaders itself started off with one person — Abby Cabunoc Mayes — mentoring ten participants, and now in its seventh round, serves six concurrent cohorts of participants with a community of mentors (many of whom were mentees in previous rounds). With conservative growth assumptions, I have modeled that within three years we could reach over 7500 scientists through Openscapes.\nFor future cohorts, Openscapes candidates will nominate themselves and there will be a formal selection and review process. In this inaugural pilot cohort, I selected Champions with whom I had already been having informal discussions on these topics for months or years.\n\n\n\n\nSo what is the meat of the Cohort Calls? I am developing a lessons series that is framed around a scientific publication that I led with my team: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools. The paper is a retrospective of how the Ocean Health Index workflow changed over four years; the Openscapes Series aims to help guide others to incrementally make progress themselves, no matter where they are starting from and where they hope to get. The first half of the series focuses on efficiency and open culture within the lab, and the second half is about sustained learning and bringing these practices to the broader campus community.\nI have been writing my plans down in the Champions Series, which serves as a free, open-source curriculum. It is currently in heavy development (and I am of course behind) but it is openly available as I progress. It is a resource for the Champions program, for stand-alone workshops that are currently in design, and available for anyone to discover, use, and remix. I don’t scroll through the Series as I teach, but I instead create slides from it; the Series serves as my lecture notes.\nAnd again, software really helps me be coordinated and share my work as I go along.\n\n\nI’m writing the Series with bookdown, which is created by Yihui Xie at RStudio and is a way to organize and format RMarkdown documents into books you can read on your computer or device. Using bookdown lets me share my progress as soon as I’ve written it. I’ve written other bookdown books for open data science trainings and really advocate for others to use it to write lab protocols, lessons, whole theses — I certainly wish I could have written my whole PhD thesis with bookdown!\nThe openscapes.org website is another place where the Champions program has a home online. I developed this website with blogdown, which is also which is created by Yihui Xie at RStudio and is a way to organize and format RMarkdown documents into websites with easy blogging capabilities. (Note: there are less involved ways to create websites with RMarkdown, I’ve made a training about basic RMarkdown websites too).\nIt is really empowering that I, who am not a web designer or publisher, am able to make and maintain beautiful website and books. It really clarifies and provides structure for my thinking and communication. And, that I am able to do so without a lot of additional software, since both blogdown and bookdown are based in R, RStudio, RMarkdown, git, and GitHub, which are already the tools for my analyses and scientific workflows. Thank you Yihui and the RStudio team!\n\n\n\n\nThe Openscapes Champions program began in January and has already had our first one-on-one mentorship calls and two Cohort Calls. They seem to be going well! On the second call we had 15 lab members in addition to the 7 Champions and there has been good discussions and feedback. Some good questions have come up, like “how do you help people learn from each other in the lab, particularly with lots of turnover?”, “how do you reduce the time it takes to get back into a project from months ago?”, and “what’s a good way to set up GitHub for the lab?” Each call we end with some “efficiency tips”, which so far have been keyboard shortcuts that are incredibly satisfying time-savers.\nI’ve learned that I need to leave even more time for discussion, both as a group and in the breakout groups. Having the time and place to think and talk about these issues is valuable, and I need to balance it and become more compact with what I want to teach. While I have a plan for the Series, I am constantly trying to incorporate needs and questions into it so that this experience is as valuable as possible. Everyone has been really patient and supportive and I will be busy improving everything as we go along.\nWe have started cataloging the labs’ approaches to reproducibility, collaboration, and communication, which we will use to help identify places for incremental improvement to prioritize next steps. More on this in another post! And I will also introduce the Champions and their labs, who have been really great and working on exciting and critical environmental questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy mentoring early career researchers in leadership roles, Openscapes helps create more champions for open, collaborative data practices. Openscapes complements existing efforts in this space (e.g. rOpenSci, RLadies, RStudio, The Carpentries) by working with scientists who have not yet engaged in open data practices, meeting them where they are, and facilitating their engagement with existing open tools and communities.\nWe are excited to help grow the community of practice by mentoring and supporting scientists to champion open practices in their labs and departments!\n\n\nPhoto by Elliot Lowndes"

    "text": "Background: a tale of two workflows\nWe were motivated to set up cloud infrastructure because we aim to minimize “the time to science” to support researchers. Downloading data to then analyzing locally isn’t an ideal workflow for many reasons, including because the data are getting bigger which leads to long download times and expensive storage, but also because clicking and downloading isn’t reproducible — and that is with data access alone, long before data analysis and science begins.\nAn alternate workflow is to use a managed JupyterHub like ours with 2i2c, which enables you to take your computer to the cloud right next to NASA Earthdata in US-West-2, which was chosen by NASA because it is technically a carbon neutral data center.\nWe see a future with cloud deployments. However, there are challenges that are listed here. I want to credit and thank Ryan Abernathy from Pangeo for raising the points I’ve marked with **!\n\nBig Data: datasets are growing too rapidly and legacy software tools for scientific analysis can’t handle them. This is a major obstacle to scientific progress.**\nTechnology Gap: a growing gap between the technological sophistication of industry solutions (high) and scientific software (low).**\nSkills Gap: a growing gap between technical skills required to use the cloud.\nReproducibility: a fragmentation of software tools and environments renders most geoscience research effectively unreproducible and prone to failure."

This has been my work with corn, which is a base image that allows the provisioning of a multi-kernel Docker base image for Jupyterhub deployments. corn uses the amazing Pangeo’s base image, installs all the environments it finds under ci/environments and makes them available as kernels in the base image so users can select which kernel to use depending on their needs. We’re able to update this environment leveraging GitHub Actions and deployment as shown in the following figure.\n\n\n\n\nIntegration between Openscapes and 2i2c.

We installed a GitHub GUI Plugin/Addon that is really helpful for learners/researchers as they learn a lot of new setup to work on the Cloud. Actually we installed it upon request of a NOAA scientist who is a very active GitHub user and prefers it to the command line for her own work as well as for teaching others. We also have installed R and Matlab on the JupyterHub to support scientists working in those languages, and are working to leverage our development in Python without having to repeat in R and Python (for example, using reticulate). We are focused on tutorials and documentation, using Quarto to build these resources that are then incorporated into the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook. We’re also focused on visualizing workflows, in part through the awesome Cheatsheets led by NASA Openscapes Mentors at PO.DAAC - Catalina Oaida Taglialatela and Cassie Nickles!"

We have been learning from the research teams we’ve been working with and are advocating for this to be part of NASA Core Services – we are drafting a white paper about it. There are tradeoffs, the cloud is not a silver bullet: Costs are real, and the operational complexity for the maintainers is not trivial.\nI’m continuing to work with others to improve corn and our setup, and particularly with 2i2c and the OpenSARLab Mentors at the Alaska Satellite Facility, to combine our approaches, develop new capabilities, and make the JupyterHub the most flexible and powerful both for admins and researchers to support research using NASA Earthdata on the Cloud - and beyond."

    "text": "Our Openscapes Cohort: CSU COAST\nWe recently wrapped up the 2-month CSU COAST Openscapes Champions Cohort, sponsored by The California State University Council on Ocean Affairs, Science & Technology(COAST). Participating teams included:\n\nthe Nielsen lab from SFSU, which focuses on coastal ecosystems,\nthe Ruttenberg lab from Cal Poly SLO, which focuses on marine conservation,\nthe Claisse lab from CPP, which focuses on applied marine ecology,\nthe Haupt lab from CSUMB, which focuses on kelp forest and intertidal ecology,\nthe Logan lab from CSUMB which focuses on marine environmental physiology,\nthe Silbiger lab from CSUN, which focuses on quantitative marine ecology,\nthe Nickols lab from CSUN, which focuses on coastal ecology and oceanography.\n\nTogether, over four sessions, we discussed coding and culture best practices, developed pathway documents to guide and plan our progress, and had our first seaside chats to begin implementing actionable items. The pathway document is a great way to take stock of where we are and what we need to do to achieve our goals, and arguably the most important thing to come out of this workshop is the seaside chats. Deliberately setting aside time in addition to or instead of regular lab meetings to implement parts of our pathway, share new tools, or simply have a group discussion is invaluable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the the open data science landscape, there are many paths forward. Through the Champions program, researchers move from lonely research to team science with a cohort of peer teams by exploring pathways together. Artwork by Allison Horst\n\nOne of the earliest topics we discussed was Github, and most people were excited to utilize it more. For some of us, it was a familiar tool that we’d been meaning to make more use of, and for others it was almost entirely a new concept. But by the end of the program we were more knowledgeable and equipped to use everything from Github repos to issues and pages. In our last meeting, the Silbiger lab group brought up the possibility of setting up a Github pages branch to selectively expose parts of a repository to the public while keeping sensitive information private, which is a great idea to eliminate the need for extra repositories and streamline the onboarding process for new students.\n\n\n“It’s ok to have a workflow you prefer as long as you make that as obvious and accessible as you can”\n\n\nThinking about data science from an open science perspective was helpful to a lot of people in the cohort. Learning to separate data wrangling from data analysis and not reinventing the wheel with our projects was an important takeaway from the program. Much of the focus was on finding and sharing new tools, as well as positioning ourselves to fully take advantage of them by having reproducible workflows. As Emily in the Nickols lab pointed out, “it’s ok to have a workflow you prefer as long as you make that as obvious and accessible as you can” which I think is a great way of thinking about an open science mindset. Perhaps the most surprising thing people learned was the usefulness of Twitter as a tool to find and share open science techniques, especially for R. The image below shows one of the good plot/bad plot examples created in Dr. Silbiger’s class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet from @NSilbiger: Nyssa shared with our cohort that in her course they had a “bad plot” competition taking everything they’d learned about data vizualation and then breaking all the rules\n\nAdditionally, discussing deliberate ways to foster the lab cultures we want was an important part of our conversations, and each lab generated a code of conduct if they didn’t already have one. Posted online through lab websites (or GitHub pages), these documents are living and we will revisit them periodically in the future.\nBy the end of the program, each lab in the cohort had made strides in their pathway. To mention a few, the Claisse lab highlighted their current efforts to organize samples and streamline communications, as well as future steps focused on promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) into their daily science practices and “communicating my data experience to others.” The Silbiger lab aimed to use seaside chats as an opportunity to code together and is exploring launching a Github pages branch for their lab.\nThe Openscapes cohort was a great followup to the 10-week supercharge plan our lab did beforehand. My lab, the Logan lab, has plans to better organize and track our data as well as develop standardized onboarding/offboarding processes. Of course, there is a lot of overlap between what we all want to accomplish, and I hope we will continue to communicate with others in the cohort as we work through our pathways. I am excited to take off running with what I learned and I know the rest of the cohort teams are as well!"

This cohort had eight cohort calls over four months - while in 2021 we started experimenting with shorter 2-month cohorts, we thought that incorporating new protocols lessons would benefit by a longer time period (the SASI Cohort had a similar timeline to the 2019 inaugural cohort). Each cohort call included a welcome and code of conduct reminder, two teaching sessions with time for reflection in small groups or silent journaling and group discussion before closing with suggestions for team meeting topics before next time (“Seaside Chats”), Efficiency Tips, and Inclusion Tips.\n\n\n\nSASI Champions during a Cohort Call"

    "text": "What did participants achieve?\nThis cohort was an opportunity for SASI principal investigators and their teams to explore collaborative approaches to shared workflows, specifically using protocols.io as well as other tooling like Google Drive, Slack, R, and GitHub. And it was also an opportunity to connect and strengthen community across the SASI grantee network and discuss common techniques and challenges. Themes we revisited throughout the cohort included how to share protocols for reuse and iteration, how to troubleshoot and share negative results, how to take inventory as there might be multiple versions of the same protocol in use, how to onboard new people to techniques used in the lab, and how to strengthen resilience within the lab so folks can work asynchronously, remotely, and help each other if someone is not available.\nThroughout the cohort, teams had the time to think through and discuss together about how their protocols were currently managed. This often led to the realization that there were inefficiencies in how they were being maintained and shared. The cohort created the “space and place” for these conversations (something that has been an emerging theme we’ve written about from other Openscapes cohorts). Transitioning workflows, upskilling together and adapting as folks onboard and offboard takes time, and is a constant work in progress. Much of the momentum and achievements of SASI teams overlapped and reinforced each other but fit into a few broader themes:\nShift towards collaborative protocols - teams had the space to talk about developed a deeper understanding of the benefit of sharing protocols, and sharing them earlier for feedback and iteration, along with practical hands-on knowledge of how protocols.io can help. One participant said that the Cohort “definitely helped with creating a sense of urgency in organizing protocols and data.” Several labs focused on taking inventory of existing protocols and organizing Google Drive in preparation for shifting to protocols.io.\nSomething that also came through is that the shift towards collaborative protocols - whether with protocols.io or otherwise - requires lots of pre-work beforehand, including shared intent, organization, inventory, consolidation/updating. This means that there must be shared organization that the group agrees on - naming conventions, where they live, how folks access and contribute. The need for shared organization and how teams tackle it shows up as Google Folders, paper notebooks, as well as protocols.io workspaces.\nShift in thinking about collaboration in and outside the lab - the idea of Future You as your most important collaborator, and Future Us as a team-mindset that others will build from your work resonated with this cohort. This came through a deeper understanding of how being intentionally inclusive about collaboration is different from default approaches, workflows, and often tooling. In their final pathways presentations where they shared their progress, several labs focused on onboarding - focusing their efforts with what someone needs to know to be successful when they first join the lab. They also modeled having a safer space to talk about the challenges they’ve been having and start moving towards solutions.\nShifting to collaborative approaches also requires time. Researchers have little time to enact new practices alongside their current workloads, but it is critical to interact with others within their research group and outside of the lab. There was an emphasis on the importance of community; and how to best connect with other researchers studying the same organism or technique. Participants expressed a need to be able to ask questions and compare approaches with researchers working in the same systems."

These teams were so generous and gracious as they made time to learn together and help each other, and it wasn’t possible for everyone to be at every session. We saw a commitment within these teams and know that they’ll be continuing to incorporate what they’ve learned as they’re able to. We loved the vignettes that folks shared in the final call, where each team gave a 3-minute “screenshare and tell” to describe their progress and pathway forward. We heard stories of a 1st year grad student who was onboarding to their new lab and transcribed his notes into protocols.io, which allowed the lab tech to review and add clarifications and missing details; stories of a shared bioinformatics workflow Google Doc that has a linked table of contents and code written out with narrative for each step; stories of pressure-testing the resilience of the lab set up to determine weakpoints as well as what works for collaborations and mentoring within the lab; and stories of overwhelm with where to start, so focusing on onboarding through the question “if someone new were starting in the lab tomorrow, what should they know if we were just going to show our protocols.io workspace”, which they began to populate with the “everyday things”.\nSomething that we remarked about with Lenny and Emma is that we’re seeing a shifted mindset around open science, and it was really evident with the Cohort. It’s less that research teams need to be convinced that open science is a good thing - the challenge is the time and support involved to put it to practice."

They study how cytoplasm is spatially patterned and how cells sense their own shape. They also investigate how timing in the cell division cycle can be highly variable yet still accurate. For their work, we combine quantitative live cell microscopy and computational, genetic and biochemical approaches in fungal and mammalian cells. GitHub/protocols.io:https://github.com/GladLab/GladLab /https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/gladfelterlab\nThe Frederickson Lab at the University of Toronto focuses on the ecology and evolution of mutualism, or cooperation between species. Mutualisms are extremely common in nature—so common, in fact, that every plant and animal on Earth may be involved in at least one mutualism. The Frederickson Lab uses field, molecular, and computational approaches to study diverse plant-animal and host-microbe mutualisms, with the goal of understanding how and why species cooperate.\nThe Bolnick Lab at the University of Connecticut seeks to understand how ecological interactions affect the evolution of within-species trait variation. Research in the lab touches on a wide variety of species interactions, and combines theoretical models, natural history, field and lab experiments, and meta-analyses. Currently evolution of vertebrate immunity to parasites is a major, but not exclusive, focus of the lab.\nThe Milligan-Myhre Lab at the University of Connecticut focuses on how host genetic background contributes to the balance between the immune response to microbiota in the gut and intestinal microbial membership. While some disease phenotypes are controlled by one or two genes, other diseases, like inflammatory bowel diseases, have many genes involved that each have a small effect. We developed the genetically variable threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a model to examine how host genetic background influences immune response to microbiota in the gut and gut microbial community membership, and use it with the hopes that these mechanisms will elucidate genetic contribution to human diseases like inflammatory bowel diseases.\nThe Zheng Lab at the Carnegie Institution for Science has a long-standing interest in cell division and cytoskeleton. In recent years, the findings they made have broadened their research scope to include three research areas: 1. The mechanism of cell division. 2. The mechanism of genome organization in development, homeostasis, and aging. 3. The mechanism of endosymbiosis in cnidaria. They use a wide range of tools and systems, including genetics in model organisms and creating new model organisms, cell culture, biochemistry, proteomics, genomics, in their research.\nThe Amend Lab at the University of Hawaii examines the causes and consequences of microbial composition at the population and community scales. Their research includes Diversity and Evolution of Fungal Endophytes in Native Hawaiian Plants; Biogeography of Small Organisms; Habit Connectivity and Microbial Reservoirs; and Diversity and Distribution of Marine Fungi.\nThe Patel Lab at the Marine Biological Laboratory are beginning to explore the degree to which developmental pathways have been conserved or altered between various arthropods. Insights into the nature of developmental and molecular alterations will help to understand the evolutionary changes in the mechanisms of pattern formation and provide a molecular basis for analyzing the diversification of body morphologies and developmental mechanisms. The current work in the Patel Lab can be divided into three main project areas: The role of homeotic (Hox) genes in the evolution of body morphology; Germ line regeneration in Parhyale hawaiensis; and Structural color in Butterflies."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Last month I was invited to give a workshop at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s Essential Open Source Software virtual conference. The workshop was about Audience Building for Open Source Projects, focused on strategic planning and sustainability. I was both nervous and excited to give this workshop: nervous because I am by no means an expert in how to grow and sustain a project — Openscapes is still nascent! But I was excited because although I am not an expert, I do know a lot and was interested to pass forward what I’ve learned. This post is a quick overview and a summary of participant activites.\nQuick links:\n\nslides\n#EOSSmtg\n\n\nThe Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s Essential Open Source Software program supports and connects folks building open source software for science. I was very excited to attend to meet folks and learn about the cool things they are developing. And, I was excited to see a keynote by Kate Bouman, whose team used open algorithms and open data to “make” the first image of a black hole!\nI was invited to give a workshop about audience building and strategic planning for open source projects. Here is the abstract I wrote for the workshop:\n\n\n“Open source software is about more than code: it’s about welcoming a broadening audience to a shared vision and planning for sustainability. We’ll cover considerations for open source programs including messaging &”marketing”, onboarding, inclusion, community building, web presence & technology choices, and fundraising, using Openscapes strategies as a starting example.”\n\n\nI framed the workshop in broad categories: communication, community building, and sustainability. We talked about each category in turn, although the process is not linear, it’s iterative, reinforcing, and overlapping. Essentially, there are many things to do at the same time that are all linked together. And the overarching themes that come up throughout the whole process — built into everything you do, into every decision you make — is openness, inclusion, and maintenance. So, for every decision you make, you should ask yourself: am I being as open as I can be, am I being as inclusive as I can be, and will I be able to maintain what I’m starting. This will help prioritize where you put your efforts.\n\n\n\n\n \nI have learned so much from my mentors and many open projects that I have been introduced to in the past several years. I highlighted the main resources that frame my thinking for how I think about audience building:\n\nMozilla Open Leaders\n\nOpen Leadership Training Series\nWork Open, Lead Open (#WOLO)\nMovement building from home\n\nScientific Gateways Community Institute\n\nsciencegateways.org\nFocus Weeks\nCase Studies\n\nOpen Source Alliance for Open Scholarship\n\nHandbook\n\n\nI put additional references on each of the slides that you can refer to to learn more. I also had 3 silent activities throughout the workshop for folks to reflect on each of the categories we talked through. The first activity asked folks to respond in chat: What is a potential next step for you in terms of communication (audience, messaging, web)? Here are some of the responses:\n\nBlogs and/or guided lessons on how to use our tool\nMaking our homepage messaging more inclusive for our various audiences\nDrafting a Slack community and user guide to share on our community Slack\nTutorials\nUser survey\nEmail newsletter for communication.\nRe-thinking our community forum structure, in order to incentivize more people to engage and reward them for helping others\nVideo onboarding\nUpdate our website, regular communication to community through newsletter, social media\nRedesigning the website, driven by specific user groups!\n\n\nThe second activity used Abby Cabunoc Mayes’ Mountain of Engagement image along with the “stamp” feature in Zoom: participants placed a stamp or drawing where they felt their project lands on this mountain. This was fun to see happen live! There are a lot of folks transitioning into Sustained Participation, Networked Participation, and Leadership:\n\n\n\n\nThe Mountain of Engagement from Abby Cabunoc Mayes’ talk at the CZI EOSS kickoff meeting:  Work Open, Lead Open (#WOLO)\n\n\n\nThe final activity asked folks to write responses in chat to the question: How could you use help with sustainability (strategic planning, governance, and onboarding)?\n\nGovernance is the biggest question-mark in my org\nChallenges about gracefully moving back and forth between cycles of high-level strategic planning, and low-level “getting things done on the daily”\nSetting aside time to explicitly do this work. It tends to drop down the list of to-dos\nWe need to test business models for longer term sustainability.\nDefine and stick to a roadmap, and better communicate it with the community (and how expected timelines depend on contributions and funding)\nHow do you convince project members that governance is worth discussing before the project has scaled up to the point where governance is clearly needed?\nMaking onboarding easy\nConsidering the most efficient way to do a gap analysis to inform these difference facets.\n\nIt was great to be able to chat further with the participants about these topics so that we can share insights and tackle them together. Thanks again to CZI for the invitation to lead this workshop: it was really fun to put together — and it helped me clarify things in my own head — and I appreciate all the engaged participants!"

The goals of this session were to hear from and boost a diverse set of leaders from across the US government and academia to highlight open science in daily work, including peer-teaching, mentoring, and learning. Building from our session at ESIP Winter 2022, we hope to create more channels for inter- and cross-agency learning, and share open science stories across agencies, as part of the 2023 Year of Open Science as recently declared by the US Biden-Harris Administration. Speakers shared stories about open science in government and their experiences with Openscapes. Stories were shared in a “Fishbowl” format, where speakers each shared and then there was a broader discussion with the 50+ participants. This blog is co-authored with the speakers.\nQuick links:"

    "text": "3 approaches for the year of open science\nThis session brought together a diverse set of leaders from across the U.S. government and academia to highlight open science in daily work, including peer-teaching, mentoring, and learning. They shared stories, examples, and concrete tips for supporting each other and our colleagues with collaborative, inclusive open science approaches, with the aim of strengthening channels for inter- and cross-agency action in the Year of Open Science 2023. This session builds from our session at ESIP Winter 2022, and you can review the summary blog and videos: 3 takeaways for planning for the year of open science. Those 3 takeaways were 1. Both top-down and grassroots efforts are necessary; 2. Dissolve silos by supporting early adopters; 3. Reuse and build from existing efforts to accelerate change.\nThis year, presenters shared Openscapes stories and approaches following another year’s work mentoring, coaching, and teaching colleagues as well as listening, advocating, and informing open science policy at different levels. Their stories come from the many phases of open science movement building they represent: a first welcome, inside government organizations, “forking” Openscapes internally, and contributing back to open science. What emerged was real lightbulb moments and real-time interplay between panelists who have not previously worked together as we recognized common themes and learned from each other.\nHere are 3 overlapping takeaways from this session that all speakers embodied:\n\nExamine the cracks; invest in real relationships\nBreak the hero mentality in science; invest in radical collaboration\nBuild morale through learning; advocate for learning time\n\nWe describe these more fully below. And as we advocate for open science in this Year of Open Science, let’s connect open science with building morale and empowering individuals as well as with the higher quality of work created."

    "section": "Examine the cracks; invest in real relationships",
    "text": "Examine the cracks; invest in real relationships\n“Examining the cracks’’ was a concept brought up by Ileana Fenwick at the very beginning of our session, and it resonated with the other panelists throughout. Ileana designed and leads the Pathways to Open Science program, a remote event series of community calls and coworking for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science. The first session, held on the evening of this ESIP panel, welcomed over 80 participants! Ileana shared that as she became empowered with open science, she thought exposure alone would be enough to attract other people to open science events. It wasn’t; there are many reasons why folks do not feel included in science and open science. It caused her to examine the cracks - why wouldn’t she participate in this program if she saw it in her inbox? This influenced the design of the Pathways program, with a deep investment in engagement. Ileana partnered Openscapes with Black in Marine Science (BIMS) and Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science (BWEEMS), and met 1:1 with faculty at HBCUs, to learn about their students’ needs and introduce her ideas for the program. Ileana shared these three pieces of advice, saying”inclusion is not an afterthought”:\n\nSurface level efforts are easy to spot. Some questions to ask as you plan your program goals and efforts are: What is your motivation for this work? Is it genuine? Is the space you’re inviting students to a safe space for marginalized students? (Do they know that?) It is clear when the broader impacts are written last. Inclusion is not an afterthought, your planning and process should demonstrate that.\nWe exist. If your efforts are not yielding diverse participation, it’s not because we aren’t out there. It’s because your efforts need to be tailored more specifically and intentionally.\nCenter diverse voices. If there are no members of your team from your target audience or your team is not reflective, this is a moment to step back and ask yourself if YOU need to be the one doing this work. Amplify and empower diverse leadership, support them, compensate them, use privilege to push the project forward.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSlide from Ileana Fenwick’s talk on challenging her views on how to engage. Examining the cracks led Ileana to see that that exposure to information is not enough, and this influenced the design of the Pathways to Open Science program\n\n\nLater, Corey Clatterbuck described the momentum at the California Water Boards following an Openscapes Cohort she and Anna Holder co-led in 2022. They knew they wanted to “fork” the Openscapes curriculum to adapt it to the needs of their colleagues, so they examined the cracks using results of an internal 2019 Data Literacy Survey with Water Boards employees. Corey and Anna were surprised by the results and, like Ileana, designed their programming to meet these needs. The results showed that respondents were motivated by interest in particular data tasks (image below, top half) and not in specific software or coding languages (image below, bottom half). In short, people were more interested in learning how to do things in their job (goal-oriented), than learning specific software (tool-oriented). From this, the design of their Cohort emphasized the human over technical approach to open science to reach the majority of Water Boards colleagues who might be interested in open science. They increased the length of each call from 1.5 hours to 2 hours, and added a new module on documentation to replace the one on coding-strategies.\n\n\n \n\n\nResults from the California Water Boards internal 2019 Data Literacy Survey showed that respondents were motivated by interest in particular data tasks (top half) and not in specific software or coding languages (bottom half). Examining these cracks influenced how Clatterbuck and Holder forked and designed the Champions Program at the California Water Boards. (slide from Clatterbuck)\n\n\nIleana’s approach of “Examining the cracks” also caught Cassie Nickles’ ear. She is a Mentor with NASA Openscapes, a community that supports researchers as they migrate analytical workflows to the Cloud. Cassie and her colleagues across other NASA Earthdata data centers are co-creating common tutorials, a review & reuse process, and as well as community of practice for teaching, mentoring, and facilitation for NASA Earthdata Cloud. As she was onboarding into her current role, Cassie became overwhelmed by the steps and processes required by end users to access and use NASA Earthdata. She figured if she was confused, others might be too and wanted to help simplify navigating the complicated systems.\n\nThe data analysis needed for the pressing problems we face should not be limited by the complexity of the underlying systems or a lack of computer engineering skills. - Luis Lopez, NSIDC\n\nCassie and Openscapes Mentor-colleague Catalina Oaida Taglialatela made Cheatsheets with clickable icons that lead to tutorials for NASA Earthdata Cloud researchers! Having filled some gaps, Cassie is now recognizing more cracks moving forward: how do we get these resources in front of the folks they’re intended for?"

    "section": "Break the hero mentality in science; invest in radical collaboration",
    "text": "Break the hero mentality in science; invest in radical collaboration\nErin Robinson opened the session saying that solutions to large-scale environmental and social challenges require radical collaboration, but have been limited by the hero model, where science is competitive, siloed, and rewards an individual hero, often a white man. She said we together are changing this story. We do this by welcoming people where they are and through creative approaches that blend methods from open source software development, mentoring, coaching, and art.\nReflecting as a Mentor at NOAA Fisheries supporting 6 Openscapes cohorts (240 staff) in 2022, Josh London said that “collaboration is something we’re never taught.” Individuality is instilled in grad school and we never have a chance to change this through “business as usual.” We need the space and place to relearn. Don’t spend your time trying to solve things yourself. Learn together first! It’s ok to ask for help early. Adyan Rios is also a NOAA Fisheries Mentor, who is helping develop a learning culture at the Southeast Fisheries Science Center through leading “Surf Sessions” where colleagues cowork remotely and share what they know. Adyan echoed this need for radical collaboration, saying that it’s radical because it means being vulnerable. It means people sharing things they haven’t figured out yet, while they’re still messy. Or share a cool thing you learned, like a keyboard shortcut. If you just learned it, chances are someone in your community didn’t know it yet either. Sharing makes their day a little better and make their work more efficient. This harkens back to Cassie creating cheatsheets to share what she figured out to help others.\n\n\n“Team collaboration is not something that we’ve all learned from the beginning. In grad school it’s instilled in us this idea that anything meaningful that we do in science is supposed to be done by us as individuals.” – Josh London\n\n\n\n::: {.blockquote-blue} > “This mindset and practice [of learning together first] has been revolutionary for us at NOAA.” — Adyan Rios\nBreaking the hero model is something that Luis Lopez has been thinking about too. He shared that as a software engineer, something he has learned through the NASA Openscapes Mentors community is to empathize with researchers and not expect that software alone is the hero. The key is to really understand learners and researchers, get to know them and see how they work and where they are stuck. Working with his NASA Mentor colleagues, Luis identified that there were many steps involved before researchers could be hands-on with data in the cloud, and was intent on reducing that “time to science”. Luis has led development of the earthaccess python library to search, download or stream NASA Earth science data, enabling a researcher to get to the science with four lines of Python code, instead of running command line code that saves a hidden .netrc file to the user’s computer and requires reactivation after one hour. Collaborating with other Mentors has been critical here – again breaking the hero model – as Cassie’s Cheatsheets helped visualize all the steps previously involved that were cumbersome for scientists."

    "text": "Build morale through learning; advocate for learning time\n“How to make learning part of your job” and “When do you carve out time to learn” are questions that come up frequently, as they did here. Pointing to examples of how other individuals and agencies do this has been super powerful: it is negotiated with supervisors at NOAA to be included in Individual Work Plans, and the NASA Earthdata Mentors are a fantastic example of the power of high-level support for learning. The NASA Mentors shared how the Mentor community has been able to learn and collaborate together over the past two years. This was because their time was approved at a high level, by NASA policy and by their managers. This approved time has given space for them to first share and listen, find the common, and then build together, reuse, and amplify.\n\n\n“Learning builds morale: it gives people an opportunity to change workflows, learn new skills, improve the culture, and take ownershipof that” — Josh London\n\n\nWe’re seeing some of this trickle out beyond the Openscapes curriculum. Josh London talked about how we often focus on the shiny new tools (python, R, Quarto, GitHub) but it’s the culture shifts that are the real meaningful change. He said it’s so encouraging to see in a calendar invite for a meeting that someone’s already initiated an agenda in a shared document and that there are multiple people contributing notes there at the same time. Additionally, learning to use tools like GitHub for shared “todo” lists and better project management for teams has increased morale for NOAA Fisheries teams. Teams are also using these tools for more inclusive communication to onboard other team members to their projects, passing forward this increased morale that comes from learning together.\nLoneliness during the Pandemic was mentioned several times - Adyan, Cassie, Corey, and Ileana all onboarded to their current roles during the pandemic. They noted that shared practices like coworking along with collaborating asynchronously with GitHub and Google Docs helped them feel less alone and build real connections with their colleagues. And, it helped them learn skills they needed to do their jobs. They saw that these skills would help other colleagues as well, so they have dedicated time to teaching and supporting colleagues, and advocating for learning time from supervisors.\n::: {.blockquote-blue} > “Not everyone needs the same learning curve; we can send down a rope and help others get to where they need to be sooner.” — Adyan Rios\n\n\n \n\n\nThe California Water Boards Openscapes Cohort emphasized psychological safety and culture, uniting data strategies, and documentation to create a welcoming environment, build community, and reduce loneliness in learning new skills.

The vision is what’s possible because of open science: climate solutions, social justice, and democracy.

This adds more things to learn up front, but the payoff is substantial.\nIf you want to learn R and GitHub together, I would recommend starting with R for Excel Users (Lowndes & Horst 2020) that we developed for the 2020 RStudio Conference (similar resource is the Ocean Health Index’s Intro to Open Data Science, which the OHI team developed and has been teaching from for years and has recordings).\nR for Excel Users has lessons for a 2-day course, broken into 1.5-hour sessions. It starts with how to install all the software you will need for the course, and then each chapter builds from the previous, so that you practice your skills together as a workflow.\nI would also recommend watching the RStudio webinar called “Advanced Data Science: Collaboration and time travel — version control with git, github, and RStudio” (navigate there from the Learning Roadmap).\nNote: If you want to learn R without GitHub at this point, you can still use this book to do it by skipping the GitHub parts."

These “go tell your roommate” debriefs are often not a summary or synthesis, but moments or details or feelings that really stand out. They are little micro-stories we can amplify. So here are some of these “roommate moments” from posit::conf that I wanted to share.\n\nPenobscot Indian Nation opening video\nThe whole conference kicked off with a beautiful and inspiring video with the Penobscot Indian Nation. It was narrated by Jan Paul and told the story of the pollution of the Penobscot River and how water quality monitoring and data analysis by Jan and her colleagues are helping turn this around. Seeing this as the kick-off for the conference and meeting Jan was a highlight of the whole conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe posit::conf stage with Hadley Wickham showing thanks to Jan Paul, Angie Reed & the Penobscot Indian Nation for the conference kickoff\n\nI also met Jan Paul’s colleague Angie Reed in person (!!!); Angie was a 2021 Openscapes Champion with the Tribes and the Exchange Network team and doing big work around data science skills across Tribes. (We met because Ben Marwick specifically connected us; I know Ben through rOpenSci). The Tribal Exchange Network is looking for folks to sign up and help this community with R/Python support!\n\n\nR-Ladies community\nOne of my absolute favorite talks was by Riva Quiroga: Sustainable Growth of Global Communities: R-Ladies’ Next Ten Years. Riva shared the story of how a large global community has changed its leadership seamlessly and inclusively with deep thought and intention. As part of this, they upgraded their membership system in a cost-effective and code-forward approach, while continuing to support the community throughout. They shared how the transition from manually entering member bios for the website from a Google Form to switching to Airtable that automatically updates the website using a scheduled cron job and GitHub Action was very interesting to me, and something we can learn from.\nR-Ladies is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community. One way I have felt this is when R-Ladies band together to sit in the front rows of each others’ talks, and if there is ever a question of which talk to go to, you choose an R-Ladies talk and support them for being there. R-Ladies has not only changed individual lives and career paths but the R community as a whole. I really liked when Mo Mowinckel emphasized this at the RLadies Global Meetup on Thursday.\nI spoke with several people for whom this was their first posit::conf who commented how many women were at a tech conference – and how connected they were. That doesn’t happen by accident - that is the result of the unrelenting and huge amount of work of many awesome women and gender minorities in the R community, and so many awesome allies and supporters from every aspect. This includes Posit, who pays for the room for us to all gather at the end of the conference (and supported all 5 people from RLadies Leadership to be in the same place for the first time - see DrMowinckel’s post! I am so proud to be a part of R-Ladies, and want to increase my involvement since I and the other co-founders of our R-Ladies Santa Barbara Chapter passed on to new leadership in early 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelfie: Deepsha Menghani, Julie Lowndes, Yanina Bellini Saibene\n\nI got to meet Yanina Bellini Saibene in person! Yani is the Community Manager at rOpenSci, and on the leadership team of R-Ladies and The Carpentries. We talked about how important it is to be active across these different communities and how we collaborate and not complete, and this is something that we will continue strengthening in the years to come. She talked about all of the amazing R packages that rOpenSci Champions are developing, and that teams often want to join together as Champions to think about package maintenance as a team. I wonder if this will be something for the NASA- and NOAA-Openscapes teams in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelfie: Monica Gerber, Julie Lowndes, Hannah Frick\n\nI really appreciated talking with Silvia Canelón and Millie Symns throughout the conference. Millie gave a fantastic talk about her journey from becoming an observer to contributor in her talk Side effects of blogging for a year. Hannah Frick is always a fave person to see, and has been part of the R-Ladies’ global leadership for a long time. I’m excited to hear more about her work with LatinR and more; she chaired several sessions and we had brief hi’s in between.\nI also really liked Liz Roten’s talk “There is an I in Team”, sharing how to onboard folks to your data science team and shared workflows. There were many other great talks by R-Ladies that I saw throughout the week and am excited to watch the ones I missed, including SherAaron Hurt from the Carpentries’s R you Ready! talk.\n\n\nQuarto features and partnerships\nThere are new exciting features and partnerships with Quarto!\nMine Çetinkaya-Rundel talked about Reproducible manuscripts with Quarto and a new partnership with the American Geophysical Union (AGU) to make this happen. This upends the idea that the PDF is the main element for publishing: it’s: “an end-to-end scholarly publishing workflow that treats Jupyter and Quarto notebooks as a primary element of the scientific record” and “A publication process that elevates transparent and reproducible work by authors, where data and software, together with narrative, are documented, shared, and archived.” Quarto can already use hypothesis.io for commenting, which helps you track-changes when collaborating in Quarto docs.\nCharlotte Wickham shared about new features coming in the next Quarto release (by Christmas). I’m excited about code annotation, and embedding the output of one notebook into another (with provenance), and the JupyterLab extension that will help the NASA Mentors edit Quarto documents in our 2i2c JupyterHub. I also spoke with J.J. Allaire and the Quarto developer team about some specific features that would help NASA Openscapes Mentors build a single Quarto book with notebooks from multiple repositories, and our plan is to collaborate soon to make this happen, which is super awesome.\nThere are a lot of other great features and examples with Quarto that I will continue to learn about post conf.\n\n\nBlack hair and data science have more in common than you think\nKari Jordan is Executive Director of The Carpentries. Her talk about Black hair and data science have more in common than you think was really thought-provoking. Kari created a fabulous table categorizing hair type and data type and the tools and workflows required. I have a long way to learn from communities of people who are different from me, and I really appreciated this chance with Kari. This was an intimate and brave talk, one that Kari said she adapted for a Posit audience since she first gave it at Spelman College, a historically Black liberal arts college for women in Atlanta, Georgia. I also loved that Kari’s niece attended sessions with Kari and Sher! throughout the week!\n\n\nwebR for reproducibility & teaching\nJames Balamuta presented about webR, and demonstrated how “this approach can transform static Quarto documents into dynamic examples by leveraging webR’s capabilities through standard Quarto code cells, enabling real-time execution of R code and dynamic display of results. Our approach empowers educators and researchers alike to harness the power of interactivity and reproducibility for enhanced learning and research experiences.” James gave Eli Holmes from NOAA Fisheries a shoutout for her early feedback and testing, which delighted me.\n\n\nShow, don’t tell\nThe keynotes this year were all really super. I’m going to focus on two:\nElaine McVey emphasized “show, don’t tell” as a strategy for getting buy-in for what you need as a data scientist. She walked through it as a cyclical process, sharing how often data scientists are hired within a team but not given access to data to do their jobs. Building relationships to understand how things work and to build trust is part of everyone being able to do their jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElaine McVey’s cyclical process emphasizing a “show, don’t tell” strategy\n\nKara Woo gave a beautiful keynote, likening the walking through the halls as tending a garden, and shared how to take what we learn and feel through this garden back to our home places. One quote that stood out to me was “if you can’t make changes because you’re afraid of breaking something, it’s already broken”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKara Woo giving her keynote\n\nAmelia McNamara, Hannah Frick, Sean Kross, Hadley Wickham and I had a mini #rstats nerd huddle between excellent keynotes by Kara Woo and JD Long:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelfie: Julie Lowndes, Hadley Wickham, Sean Kross, Hannah Frick, Amelia McNamara\n\n\n\nNOAA Fisheries and Fred Hutch Cancer Center\nSean Kross is a Data Staff Scientist at the Fred Hutch Data Science Lab. His talk was about the Tidy Data Tutor that he developed to help visualize tidyverse operations. He framed this in a bigger idea that code is data, which is something I’d never heard about before. Holy Moly Sean, Tidy Data Tutor has 50K users across 150 countries! And this growth is over maybe 2 years? Amazing. And speaks to its usefulness. Also, this paper Tools for Analyzing R Code the Tidy Way by Sean, Jeff Leek, and Lucy D’Agostino McGowan is now on my list to read! Sean Kross is such a hero of mine, one of the early friendly people that made me feel like I belonged in the R community, and I’m so thrilled that we’ve been collaborating for nearly 5 years. He was part of our very first Champions Cohort, when he was exploring studying Openscapes as part of his PhD. He has also built our kyber R package that automates a lot of our infrastructure to lead Champions Cohorts. And, now we’re leading the very first Champions Cohort at Fred Hutch, together with Stefanie Butland and Sean’s colleague (and R Lady) Monica Gerber. It was wonderful to see Sean and Monica in person! Sean also gave gave me a swirl sticker which I have coveted for a long time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOAA Fisheries Marine Mammal Lab folks with Julie and Sean.\n\nAnd, folks from the NOAA Fisheries Marine Mammal Lab were there! This is a group I’ve worked with for years now, and it was wonderful to meet in person. I remember first conversations with Josh London about how we could work together at previous RStudio conferences, and now it’s happening! We had dinner together with Sean Kross, which was awesome since all of them are based in Seattle.\n\n\nMuch much more.\nSo many hallway conversations and hugs. Davis Vaughn shared about updates to dplyr, and found me early at the Reception to ask if I needed any help with my slides. Davis has come to the rescue at both my RStudio and useR! keynotes to help with xaringan and Quarto slide sharing in the last moment of need. I so appreciate him! And fun fact: we first met because he saw my computer with stickers in the airport in London on our way to Toulouse in 2019 and came to say hi.\nTed Laderas spoke about burnout experienced by community organizers, which is real. He suggested asking for help and not taking it all on yourself as a few strategies to continue to find joy and learning with your community.\nI love talking with Andy Teucher and Steph Hazlitt and Nic Crane and learning about their work in and out of industry. And also Ciera Martinez, who was a Mozilla fellow with me and I got to not only meet her adorable toddler but also hear about really big work in biodiversity and data science that she’s doing from UC Berkeley.\nThere’s never enough time to talk to everyone and learn all the things, and that was certainly true this time. Looking forward to staying connected (seems like some combination of Mastodon & Bluesky) and seeing folks in Seattle in 2024!"

I presented this in 2 parts. First, a 5-min lightning talk with practical tips, inspired by Jenny Bryan’s Naming Files 💙; Jenny has been a huge teacher, inspiration, and role model of how to document things and share to support others, and this is an attempt to follow suit. Second, 10-min of stories with reusable strategies, from NASA Openscapes & beyond. Something that is critical to all of this is to have technical and social infrastructure, i.e. time and support to write documentation as part of your job. There is a TL;DR in the form of a preprint editorial co-authored by Openscapes Mentors across NASA, NOAA, EPA, and academia.\nHow to document things\n Have a place\n Have an audience in mind\n Design for readability & accessibility\nWalk through my slides for the details and tips!\nStories\nI shared stories about growing the NASA Openscapes Mentors community, first focusing on how documenting things helped staff collaborate from across NASA Data Centers to co-develop teaching resources to support researchers using NASA Earthdata in the Cloud. This documentation helped onboard others as contributors in three ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlide from my talk. NASA-Openscapes project website, Earthdata Cloud Cookbook, Openscapes Approach Guide.\n\nFurther, putting a focus on documentation has enabled NOAA Fisheries, California Water Boards, and others to reuse this approach. We wrote an editorial we have submitted to Nature sharing how this requires an investment in both technical and social infrastructure. We encourage making time and advocating for time to support each other in these efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlide from my talk.

    "section": "The big takeaways and tools we put into immediate action",
    "text": "The big takeaways and tools we put into immediate action\nOur lab already had existing groundwork for many of the ideas that were conveyed during the workshop. For example, we already had thefaylab GitHub account, weekly lab meetings, and weekly “Shut Up and Write” events. Our lab also occasionally hosts “Quantfish woRkshops” which are really similar to the Seaside chats or coding communities Julie discussed. Through all of our activities, we had sufficient scaffolding in place; however, there was a clear need to build upon the existing infrastructure and improve these activities and how we (both as individuals and as a group) interact with them. We recognized that within our research lab group there would be more turnover than occurs within other organizations and so being able to preserve and transfer institutional knowledge was a priority.\nGitHub Issues. One chosen way to address this concern was through developing a new private GitHub repository in thefaylab account use it for Issues. Issues are a great tool that can be used to track ideas, collaborative tasks, software or coding bugs and problems, or create a to-do list all within a repository. For us, we are using Issues like we would use email - except in GitHub, questions, answers, and other pertinent information are stored in a central place and able to be shared, accessed, and easily searched by all past and present lab members.\nLive Google Docing. Additionally, to improve our weekly lab meetings we have started live “Google Docing”, a strategy used throughout the two-day workshop. For us, we created a “Spring lab meetings 2020” Google document that every member has access to and can take notes interactively during the meeting. This keeps everyone engaged, retains discussions and holds important information (think links to new research papers, announcements, new R packages, etc), provides another way to ask questions, and can be used by absent members as a way to stay included and up to date. We have found this method to be extremely effective (and fun!).\n\nLab Philosophy and Code of Conduct. Finally, we have started drafting our lab philosophy and code of conduct (COC) to ensure that all members understand expectations by setting a tone of inclusiveness and accountability upfront.\n\n\n \n\nCreating the lab philosophy for the Fay Lab, remotely with Zoom.

    "section": "",
    "text": "A conference for open data leaders\nI attended csv,conf,v4 in Portland, Oregon in May 2019. Here are a few reflections about the conference and a bit about my talk where I shared progress from the Openscapes Champions.\ncsv,conf,v4 has a unique name and draws a unique and powerful crowd as a “community conference for data makers everywhere”. It is the only conference I’ve ever attended with a name stemming from a format for open data (comma separated value [CSV] files), and the only conference with scheduled time with a real-life therapy llama [Rojo the Comma Llama]. It was also the most diverse conference I’ve ever attended, and was a powerful nexus to meet leaders from all corners of the open data world.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis two-day conference included thought leaders, journalists, researchers, scientists, developers, artists, managers, activists, city planners. It included diversity of expertise, diversity of lived experience, diversity of thought. It had an upfront Code of Conduct and a welcoming tone like the RStudio::conf: it was deliberately an inclusive place where it was possible to strike up a conversation with anyone and immediately have opportunities to share and learn. Also, there were 8 (!) Mozilla Fellows past and present in attendance, which was really exciting (sadly, not pictured all together).\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a scientist, my entry way to the open community has been through supportive open source software and communities like R, RStudio, rOpenSci and RLadies. Through Mozilla I am getting to know a bit more of the open community more broadly, and at csv,conf,v4 it was really impactful to meet people from across fields and to see all of the ways that they think, work, and engage with open data. In all the conversations I had with people and from all the talks I saw I kept thinking that everyone at the conference was a leader. It might not be in their official job title, and they might be at csv,conf because of their official work or interests outside of work. But by attending and participating in this conference, they were there representing their communities and would be taking what they learned back with them.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is hard to capture all of the people I met, things I learned, and conversations I had. The organizing committee was incredible, thank you to the many people who worked so hard to make such a positive experience possible for all of us. There are also slides posted from all talks and will soon be video recordings available online. One talk that sticks prominently in my mind was by @Srta_peperina about @GeochicasOSM: Right now women make up only 3% of contributors to Open Street Maps, meaning that auto mechanics are mapped disproportionately to, for example, women’s clinics. As a network of women contributing to Open Street Maps, through the Calle de Las Mujeres initiative they are also mapping streets named after women and working with Wikipedia to make sure those women also has a Wikipedia page. So cool! For a broader sense of conversations and recaps from talks, check out #csvconf: I loved this summary thread by @GalaCF, all live-tweet threads by @kirstie_j and this keynote thread by @serahrono.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my talk about Openscapes I was so proud to share about the seven environmental science labs I have been working with over the past four months and how they have become champions for open data science. They have have created GitHub Organizations for their labs, and posted Codes of Conduct and shared protocols for data workflows and onboarding and offboarding lab members. They are leading weekly lab “seaside chats” to discuss data workflows and normalize talking about open data science. They are joining and leading communities outside of their labs, including starting #tidytuesday hacky hours and the first R-Ladies chapter in New Jersey. They are being ambassadors & engaging with #rstats Twitter, sharing open science and #rstats resources with their scientific networks. They are starting new scientific collaborations as a result of meeting each other through this Openscapes cohort. And there are so many other wins that I am trying to measure and share, some of which are captured on this slide:\n\n\n\n\n\nMy own path getting to the Openscapes program is because of six years of encouraging mentorship and leadership from our OHI team and the broader open data science community. It is so exciting to pass forward what we have learned and empower others to be champions for open data science. And because they are open data leaders, maybe we will see some of the Openscapes Champions at csv,conf,v5!"

    "section": "NASA Champions Cohort Overview",
    "text": "NASA Champions Cohort Overview\nThe NASA Openscapes Project is a multi-year project to develop a cohesive approach to building Cloud migration capacity across NASA Earthdata from NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) and the research teams that the DAACs support. We do this through supporting a community of NASA DAAC mentors, who are primarily dedicated to user support. This community has learned together how to use NASA Earthdata on the Cloud. They have translated that experience into a series of Hackathons, workshops, self-paced tutorial material in the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook, and through an intensive, 10-week program: NASA Openscapes Champions.\nCloud migration can often have a steep learning curve and feel overwhelming. The NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort brings together research teams that are interested in migrating their existing NASA Earthdata workflows to the Cloud with NASA DAAC Mentors who are extremely knowledgeable about the data they serve and the initial pathways to using that data on the Cloud. This Cohort provides a common, welcoming place for teams to learn together, ask questions about using the Cloud, plan their transition, and do initial experimentation using the NASA Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub. Because this is a more intensive experience, the teams build collaborative partnerships with DAAC mentors, and the mentors can more quickly identify and work on solving issues that will make Cloud migration for many more users. We led the first NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort in 2022.\nThe second NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort ran formally in April-June 2023 with seven research teams interested in a wide variety of NASA Earthdata and various stages of Cloud technology familiarity. You can learn more about their research below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoomie (♥️) of some researchers in the 2023 NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort\n\nTogether as a Champions Cohort, these teams discussed what worked and didn’t work as they migrated workflows to the Cloud, focusing on collaboration and open science. We met as a cohort five times over two months on alternating Wednesdays. Each cohort call included a welcome and code of conduct reminder, two teaching sessions with time for reflection in small groups or silent journaling and group discussion, before closing with suggestions for future team meeting topics (“Seaside Chats”), Efficiency Tips, and Inclusion Tips. All topics and the slides presented are shared on the 2023 Cohort page. Additional coworking sessions were scheduled on alternate weeks, where researchers could work quietly, screenshare to ask questions or meet with their team to discuss further. In addition, the teams have access to Openscapes’ 2i2c Jupyter Hub, which will continue for the next year. \nThanks to the NASA Openscapes Mentors for supporting the Champions and for their contributions to the curriculum! In particular, the NASA Openscapes Champions Curriculum had significant additions: \n\nAndy Barrett from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) created a version of Data Strategies for Future Us that is applicable to gridded, remotely sensed data. Slides are here: https://nsidc.github.io/data_strategies_for_future_us/data_strategies_slides#/title-slide \nAmy Steiker and Luis Lopez from NSIDC and Alexis Hunzinger from Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) refactored the Coding Strategies for Future Us to be tailored to NASA Earthdata search, the earthaccess python library, and experiences from teams at Goddard DAAC (GES DISC) have learned to use the Cloud. \nAmy Steiker from NSIDC designed and led the Earthdata Cloud Clinic! This was a hands-on 1-hour clinic that allowed teams to get familiar with the 2i2c JupyterHub, and practice finding and accessing NASA Earthdata via direct access through two methods from a Jupyter Notebook: earthaccess and Harmony-py services. This material can be found in the cookbook here -> https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/examples/Earthdata-cloud-clinic.html \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Amy Steiker teaching the Earthdata Clinic. We used Zoom’s “green check mark” feature during pauses for people to indicate that they had completed a step.\n\n\nCassie Nickles screenshared and introduced the Earthdata Cookbook and NASA Earthdata Cloud cheatsheets in the final cohort call to help teams understand available resources moving forward."

    "section": "Shared Lessons Learned",
    "text": "Shared Lessons Learned\nThe Openscapes Champions provides a space for teams to come together to learn from each other and across teams. It is a way to collaborate and distribute leadership across teams and reduce the burden on the team leader feeling the need to learn everything first to teach it to the rest of the team. Below are just a few things we’ve learned and are carrying forward. \nUnderstanding ‘When to Cloud.’ The Cloud makes some things easier and some things harder. Over the series of five synchronous cohort calls, we considered when Cloud is effective and when the download model may still be more appropriate. Andy Barrett highlighted some considerations in Call 2 on Data Strategies for Future Us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Andy’s slides.\n\nWhen to Cloud is a recent addition as an early chapter of the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook and will evolve as we continue to learn when to Cloud and when not to. Kudos to Alexis Hunzinger from GES DISC for leading this effort.\nUndifferentiated Heavy Lifting - `earthaccess` for the win! Jeff Bezos coined this term in his 2006 keynote describing AWS doing undifferentiated heavy lifting so that everyone doesn’t have to do the mucky parts. The NASA DAAC Mentors’ work with research teams allows them to identify places of friction that, if fixed once, would benefit many users. One of the places the NASA DAAC mentors, led by Luis Lopez, have done this is with earthaccess, a Python library to search, download or stream NASA Earth science data with just a few lines of code. Luis described earthaccess in a video demo we shared in Call 3, and the Cohort used earthaccess in Call 4. We heard over and over how useful earthaccess was to the Cohort teams. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoom chat from a researcher in the 2023 Champions Cohort, who also participated in the 2021 Cloud Hackathon which preceded `earthaccess` development.\n\nHowever, several challenges working with NASA Earthdata in the Cloud are still unresolved. These include: \n\nWe have made the first steps to migrating to the Cloud possible, but workflows are generally designed for serial processing. Refactoring code to take advantage of parallelization and scaling available in the Cloud isn’t a skillset we have on our project team. \nOur Cloud tutorials have been Python-centric, and Champions research teams use a variety of languages, including R, Matlab, IDL, and Fortran. File formats - particularly HDF4 and HDFEOS - that some teams used aren’t as straightforward to use in the Cloud. \nThe 2i2c JuypterHub is a great resource for initial experimentation, but teams do not necessarily want to depend on the Hub. The hurdle to go from accessing the Cloud through a GitHub login in a browser to interacting with the AWS console interface is giant. It also requires a credit card, which leads to the most consistent challenge - it is still difficult to understand how much the Cloud will cost."

    "section": "Gaining Cloud Momentum",
    "text": "Gaining Cloud Momentum\nPart of the Openscapes Champions approach is that teams decide what to work on. The teams devoted at least 8 hours a month to focus on their workflows, learning, and collaborating within and across their teams. During this time, they thought through and discussed their current NASA Earthdata workflows and planned and experimented with transitioning their workflows to the Cloud using Openscapes’ 2i2c-hosted Jupyter Hub as a first step. As in other Openscapes Champions cohorts, teams also realized the power of Open science and that open is a spectrum that includes considering future us - potentially just you or your group in 3 months. \nWe saw teams and the NASA DAAC mentors make significant progress in migrating workflows to the Cloud. A few highlights from teams that participated in the cohort included: \n\nThe Geoweaver team made a Python version of Geoweaver, pyGeoweaver, and contributed a tutorial to the EarthData Cloud Cookbook! \nThe CLIMCAPS Team did initial experiments with earthaccess. They found it was a factor of 2 faster, but expected a more significant increase in speed.\nThe HEAT Team was able to access data through earthaccess and bring it into Geopandas. They have additional work to do to use the Cloud to process data to connect to other services like GIOVANNI. \nThe S-MODE Team made initial progress using earthaccess with S-MODE data. They had challenges being able to only access one file at a time. \nThe Hydrometeorology and GESTAR Teams connected with our MathWorks contacts and made progress accessing NASA Earthdata in the Cloud via MATLAB. We’ve submitted a talk at the AGU fall conference about this, stay tuned!\nThe LASERS Team had experience with Google Earth Engine and spent some time trying to use AWS for the same tasks. They also noted how their Cloud collaboration was a pathway toward more open, collaborative work across their team."

    "text": "Onward!\nIf our NASA Openscapes Champions Cohort is any indication, the NASA Earthdata community is making significant strides in building capacity to use Cloud resources, and the transition is successfully happening. While the cohort is officially over, these teams are just at the beginning, and we are excited to follow their results. Several Champions will participate in Carpentries Instructor Training this summer; The Carpentries is a nonprofit that teaches introductory coding skills around the world, Instructor Training is not coding-specific, but it is a pedagogical approach to teaching technical topics. As part of our NASA grant, we partner with The Carpentries and are excited to extend this opportunity to Champions since many of them mentioned wanting to contribute more to open science efforts going forward.\nWe are grateful to this Champion Cohort’s early adopter spirit, their time and effort to make this migration and all of the feedback and input they provided. They all participated in this cohort, knowing that while this was the second Cohort, they were among the first research teams to use NASA Earthdata in the Cloud. What they learned and shared will make it easier for subsequent teams to make this same shift. Many teams articulated this spirit of Open leadership, explicitly asking how they could help other teams. We also learned so much, and we will refine the NASA Openscapes Champions as we plan for our next cohort and our work with the DAAC mentors in the future years of our project."

    "text": "About the NASA Openscapes Champions Teams\nCLIMCAPS Team We use a number of NASA products in CLIMCAPS to stabilize and improve the retrieval of atmospheric profiles from hyperspectral infrared measurements. These include (i) MERRA-2 and (ii) the MEASURES CAMEL dataset. We distribute CLIMCAPS as Level 2 and Level 3 files to a range of different users. Our research focuses on maintaining/improving the CLIMCAPS algorithm and collaborating with users to improve and tailor CLIMCAPS data products. Since releasing the CLIMCAPS record via GES DISC in 2020 (2002–present), we have seen our user base grow. We have had the chance to collaborate with many groups. This gave us the opportunity to address their questions, clarify the product and help prepare custom Level 3 files that are tailored to target applications. The CLIMCAPS Level 2 product contains many different types of uncertainty metrics that can be used to filter and refine data usage. We would absolutely love the opportunity to make these workflows, that we’ve helped develop for users, more widely available. I have no doubt that other communities will find it useful also, and we want, in turn, to learn from others. Experience is teaching us that good science happens when developers and scientists collaborate together. And this is why I think Cloud-based workflows is one of the most exciting technology advances in recent years.\nHEAT (HydroEnergy Analytics Team) There is an increasing global demand for food, water and energy mainly driven by rapid urbanization, rising population, economic growth and regional conflicts. As water, energy and food are interconnected and are part of a system, we will adopt an integrated Water-Energy-Food Nexus (W-E-F) approach to examine the interdependence of water, energy and food and the impacts of climate change on water, energy, and food consumption in Nepal. Nepal, a country located in Southeast Asia, presents a unique case, where the datasets are either sparse, extremely challenging to obtain, or unavailable. Assessing W-E-F Nexus is particularly challenging due to gaps in datasets and lack of long-term observations. NASA’s Earth Observation data can be used to overcome these obstacles by providing ongoing long-term observations of the planet at various spatial and temporal resolutions, effectively filling in the gaps in the data. Our approach involves utilizing data-driven techniques to analyze the W-E-F nexus at watershed level in Nepal. Specifically, we plan to combine NASA’s Earth Observation data with hydropower generation, agricultural production and socioeconomic data in Nepal to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the W-E-F nexus in the region. We have identified several potential datasets, and will address two major questions in the cohort: 1) How has water availability, hydropower generation and consumption, demographics, crop yield changed in Nepal over the last 20 years? 2) What is the relationship between change in hydropower generation with respect to changes in hydrometeorology and demographics? Outcome: We will develop a Jupyter Notebook that outlines a comprehensive method for generating outputs from data acquisition using a Cloud environment. This end-to-end process will be clearly described in the notebook, providing an intuitive and efficient workflow that can be replicated by others adhering to the open science principles. Through this effort, we aim to facilitate the use of Cloud computing in data analysis and dissemination, streamlining the research process and enabling more efficient collaboration among researchers. The final Jupyter Notebook will be shared in the collaborative space (GitHub). The pain points encountered from an interdisciplinary user’s perspective will be documented.\nLASERS Team Our team has expertise in assessing vegetation biophysical parameters using data from all platforms, terrestrial, airborne and spaceborne. We have experience in using the Google Earth Engine and ICESat-2 data to produce gridded-maps of canopy height and canopy cover and we have produced open science software tools for displaying and labeling ICESat-2 photons, e.g., PhotonLabeler, or Waveformlidar, both available on GitHub. Our research efforts of producing Landsat-resolution gridded maps of canopy height, canopy cover, and biomass, are limited in scale by using local computing and data download-intensive approaches. Educational accounts on Cloud-based platforms, such as GEE, have limitations for data availability, data volume and modeling options, and the learning curve and cost for migrating to platforms like AWS, have their own challenges. As such, we hope that by joining NASA’s Openscapes we’ll remove barriers to producing timely vegetation products at continental and global scales to better answer pressing questions in ecology while empowering students and young scientists to use Cloud-computing and open science tools. We use ICESat-2 data, Landsat, and derived data to characterize vegetation structure and estimate biophysical parameters, such as height, cover, biomass. For producing gridded maps of vegetation parameters at scales larger than regional, e.g., continental and global, the volume of data download and processing time are hampering the workflow, therefore we intend to migrate the process to the Cloud.\nGeoweaver Team Our group has a lot of interests and collaboration history with DAACs and the Earth science community, and we are dedicated to developing Geoweaver to support Earth science teams as well as DAAC staff (data pipeline, ingestion, migration, analytics) to be productive, and their work are tangible and FAIR for other scientists to reproduce. We use NASA data as input variables to AI models to train the models with the ability to discover Earth insights in time and be actionable. We are very interested in migrating the workflow into the Cloud because that is where the data is and there are data retrieval and I/O steps in our workflows which are slow if they are executed outside the Cloud. By migrating workflows into Cloud, we want to experiment and showcase that: (1) scientists can easily switch from their personal computing environments to Cloud environment seamlessly and effortlessly using Geoweaver; (2) the hybrid collaboration environment provided by NASA and researchers’ home institution, including their laptops, can work together for one single workflow (/purpose) without under-using (wasting) resources; (3) make the building-testing-debugging iteration more quick, useful, transparent, and of course FAIR (Geoweaver records everything people did no matter where) and help scientists get serious about workflow run history sharing in a single zip file; (4) show that Geoweaver is a click-button solution if scientists want to deploy their AI workflows into operational services to run periodically like every day.\nS-MODE Team Our group has a diversity of professional experience, ranging from graduate students to PI’s. Everyone in our group is interested in exploring open-source workflows on the Cloud and building machinery to analyze a variety of data from S-MODE (Sub-Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics Experiment). Our collaboration will benefit the general S-MODE community as we plan on sharing our findings. Our overall goal is to foster a data analysis community for S-MODE by creating machinery that can be used by many research groups. From Mackenzie: “I work with NASA funded saildrone data to investigate submesoscale dynamics of the upper ocean and air-sea interactions. Specifically, I am working with saildrone datasets from the Atlantic Tradewind Ocean Atmosphere Interaction Campaign (ATOMIC) and S-MODE. I analyze the saildrone data using python and Jupyter notebooks. Additionally, I use satellite data from SMAP, Aquarius, and SWOT to provide environmental context on where the saildrone data was collected. I currently download most of the datasets and keep them on my university’s HPC system. I use open-source software to analyze the data, which includes python packages such as Xarray, numpy, matplotlib, cartopy, and pandas.”\nHydrometeorology Team We are highly motivated to migrate our ground validation workflow for the NASA GPM - Global Precipitation Measurement product to the Cloud. With over a decade of experience working with ground weather radar products and developing comprehensive workflows for ground validation work, we are eager to streamline and optimize our process. We use NASA data in three areas. First, we conduct cross-validation between NASA GPM products and NOAA ground weather radar products. Second, we create synergy of multiple NASA remote sensing measurements to achieve better precipitation product. Third, we apply NASA remote sensing data to monitor and forecast natural hazards such as flash flooding, drought, tornado, etc. Our team recognizes the numerous benefits that Cloud computing resources can provide. Firstly, Cloud services are highly scalable and can easily accommodate changes in demand from other scientists. Secondly, by migrating our workflow to the Cloud, we can automate many tasks and improve efficiency while reducing the risk of errors or delays. Thirdly, Cloud computing resources are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, making it easier to collaborate with other scientists. Lastly, Cloud services can be integrated with other tools and services, such as machine learning or data analytics platforms, enhancing the overall capabilities of the workflow. We strongly believe that ground validation efforts require a global approach, and migrating our ground validation workflow to the Cloud can greatly enhance our ability to collaborate with other scientists and improve our work on a global scale.\nGESTAR Team We conduct sensor calibration, mission support and support data applications. I work in the GESTAR2 group (Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research II) at UMBC (University of Maryland, Baltimore County). Our team, lead by Dr. Strow with us has been responsible for the development of the CHIRP (Climate Hyperspectral Radiance Product) now being hosted on GES DISC DAAC and intimately concerned with the Aqua AIRS, NOAA CrIS MetOP IASI sensors so that their data can be used for climate studies. We are heavily invested in Matlab with C and Fortran libraries. We deal with 10s of TB data almost daily using the HPC at UMBC - a fantastic resource. There is an interest and growing incentive to migrate to the Cloud, but for us the capital (of effort) to ‘re-locate’ is very significant. We need to understand the cost/benefit in our situation. There is a very steep learning curve and very little time available and there isn’t a one solution to fit all."

We just wrapped up our first 2-month version of the Champions Program with the NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC). In addition, as we think about Openscapes growing, we kicked off training our first NASA Champions Mentor Cohort with seven teams, which is so exciting and still ongoing. We also ran our first open call for a Champions Cohort funded by Code for Science and Society (CS&S) and we were so excited by the response and the eight environmental science teams that we are going to work with over the next two months. This is one of two cohorts we will run in May and June; the second is supported by CSU COAST for marine scientists in the California State Universities. More details on these Cohorts below.\nAs part of the CS&S funding, which explicitly supports events that promote inclusion and broaden participation in open data science that drives scholarship, we partnered with Tara Robertson, a diversity, equity, and inclusion consultant we knew through Mozilla, as a thought partner and teacher for us as we continue to prioritize and improve approaches to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in Openscapes. We’ve discussed universal design concepts, power structures and data feminism, and much more. In another first, Tara created a new lesson on psychological safety for the Openscapes lesson series and delivered it for our NOAA NWFSC Champions Cohort. Our May 25th Community Call will be a Chat with Tara Robertson to reflect on what we’ve done together and our lessons learned. This will be an event using Spatial Chat (as we recently experienced with Ciera Martinez at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science BIDS!) and we invite you all to come and join us. More details will be upcoming here: openscapes.org/events.\nFinally, we are practicing what we teach and had our own first Openscapes‘ ‘Seaside Chat’ as a way to organize our planning with GitHub like we do with code. We’ll be updating our own Pathway document like we do with the Cohorts for where we are with Openscapes and how we continue to move forward.\n\n\n \n\nTara Robertson with the NOAA NWFSC Cohort discussing psychological safety for teamwork"

In the next months, Mentor teams will strengthen their teaching styles and skills through Carpentries Instructor Training and observing or participating in an Intro to Python/Git Carpentries Workshop, as well as our biweekly Openscapes Cohort Calls where the Mentor teams share knowledge and processes for supporting researchers using NASA DAAC data.\nAdditionally, we started Work Sessions led by Amanda Tan at UW’s eScience Institute. Work Sessions are hands-on time with the Mentors in our GitHub organization, establishing shared practices and tutorials to help researchers migrate their workflows to the cloud. Our goal is that by June we have existing cloud-based tutorials operational on 2i2c cloud infrastructure so that all Mentors can learn from this process and establish a community review process for testing these tutorials and building off of them rather than recreating across the DAACs. We also had a fun GitHub Clinic to practice GitHub features together.\nMentors will have further opportunities to teach and refine in August-November through an upcoming Openscapes Champions Cohort with science teams that use DAAC data and are interested in migrating to the cloud. More information about participating in the science team Champions cohort coming soon – we’ll be looking for research teams using data from LP DAAC, PO.DAAC, NSIDC, ASDC, or GES DISC and ready to engage in open science and migrate their workflows to the cloud.\n\n\n \n\nOpenscapes in the wild: May the Fourth be with you!

The NWFSC Cohort presented their Pathways in the last session, and it turned out that they learned a lot and achieved a lot with these first starting steps! We will test having optional follow-ups with this cohort in 3 months to check-in and provide a bit more support and accountability to see how they are progressing on their pathways and what’s changed since this session (another first for us).\nWe’re excited that the 2-month version has been such a kick-start for the NWFSC Cohort, and eager to continue iterating this in the coming year –"

But how these cohorts take the lessons and apply them into the broader world will be exciting to see.\nOur CS&S Cohort has environmental science teams from academic, nonprofit, and government organizations in the US & Canada. This was our first open call and we are excited that there is such a diversity of teams! Participants will be faculty, PhD and Masters students, post docs, managers, planners, specialists, and more. We can’t wait to learn more about their needs and what incremental progress looks like in these different settings.\nOur CSU COAST Cohort are all teams of marine researchers at California State Universities. Participants are primarily faculty, Masters students, post-docs, research scientists, and undergraduates. They are all interested in open data science but also in strengthening the COAST network, and we are really looking forward to work with them.\nStay tuned to learn more as we work with these exciting teams!\n\n\n\n \n\nPhoto by Elliot Lowndes"

    "text": "Champions Case Study: Jayasundara Lab\nWe have just concluded our inaugural cohort of Openscapes Champions. While sad to conclude, all Champion labs have so many exciting accomplishments and so much momentum for open data science, and it is truly just the beginning. Here we are posting individual case studies of accomplishments from Champions labs.\n\nThe Jayasundara Lab at the University of Maine investigates physiological and biochemical traits underlying organismal adaptation to their habitat and how these traits are altered in response to changes in physical and chemical environmental factors. Participating in Openscapes is Professor Nishad Jayasundara and technicians Remy Babitch and Molly Westbrook.\n\nMolly & Remy: Due to our lab space being relatively new, Openscapes provided an opportunity to introduce principles of open lab culture and open data analysis relatively early on in many of the projects we’re working on, rather than incorporating old data sets into newer data analytics practices. Many of our data sets are relatively small, but we’re doing our best to begin these practices now, when many of our projects are just beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Jayasundara Lab Case Study shares our accomplishments for setting up systems for data management and sharing alongside experimental design. As a relatively new lab, we are focused on two main questions: How do organisms respond to changes in their natural environment? And can wild fish populations serve as indicators of environmental health? Much of our work involves lab experiments raising live fishes in aquaria; creating shared systems for streamlining our experimental protocols and the resulting data has been our focus during Openscapes. As a preview, we learned that:\n\n\n“Our lab was able to incorporate respectful lab culture and discussion of data analysis as a part of designing experiments, lab meetings and lab dialogue much more than before. The analysis of experimental data has become as important as experimental design and data collection.”\n\n\nOur key accomplishments are:\n\nCreated the first lab code of conduct for keeping the lab space respectful and open-minded\nBegan backing up data files from experiments on lab hard drive, incorporated an organization scheme to data backups\nOpened a lab folder on google drive to share protocols, readmes, lab certifications, chemical inventory documentation and a scientific literature mini-library and to help onboard new lab members\nStarted the jayasundara-lab github account for future analysis scripts\n\n\nCongratulations Nishad, Molly, Remy, and the rest of the Jayasundara Lab!\n\n\nRelevant posts:\n\nOpenscapes Champions incorporate open practices in their science\nOpenscapes summit reflections — becoming champions\nOpenscapes summit reflections 2 — Changing the way we do science"

This was our first open call for the Champions program, meaning that Cohort teams weren’t all part of a specific community or group that was funding the Cohort. We proposed this open call to CS&S and wanted this to be an opportunity to focus on improving how we promote and support diversity, equity, and inclusion in Openscapes, since we wanted to see who would be interested if anyone could join.\nWe announced the opportunity via Twitter and our newsletter that we were leading a Cohort and waited to see how many teams would be interested (hoping there would be interest!) Thankfully, there was interest and this Cohort included eight environmental science teams from academic, nonprofit, government, and Tribal organizations in the US & Canada. They are a great group of teams and are described in detail below!\nThe CS&S Cohort was 2-months, with four sessions, like we piloted earlier this year with our NOAA NWFSC Cohort, and we continued putting to practice what we’ve been learning working with Tara Robertson to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion with open data science.\n\n\n\n\nTweets from @OG_Nancy and @martinjeanphd\n\n\n\nWith this Cohort we continued to refine the Champions lesson series, and also welcomed guest speakers from previous Openscapes Champions cohorts to share their experiences and expertise. Dr. Jessica Couture taught about the importance of and strategies for metadata, describing different types of metadata: project-level (big picture stuff), object-level (data specific stuff), and file-level (file-specific stuff). In the final session, Dr. Gavin Fay shared how the Fay Lab has continued to practice Openscapes concepts over a year after their cohort, including offboarding the co-creator of the fab FayLab Lab Manual Ashleigh Novak when she got a new job with the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy.\n\n\n“I’m in awe of how incredibly helpful this is and how this is not a conversation I’ve ever had with all the groups I’m in. I’ve heard metadata mentioned before but this is like a first day of orientation kind of thing. Incredibly helpful” — Ileana"

Teams share their Pathway that frames where they’re starting and where they would like to go in terms of reproducibility, collaboration, communication, and culture. We provide a template that builds off of Table 1 from Lowndes et al. 2017, but we’ve added this fourth important “culture” category so teams can be explicit about their plans for diversity, equity, inclusion as well as reproducibility, collaboration, and communication. In the spirit of teamwork, it was neat to see how many teams co-presented their pathways, and provided plans for how they are moving from solo practices toward shared practices.\n\n\n“There’a a lot to do [for open science], but now we can see what we need to do” — Nicola\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example Pathway document presented by a Champions team\n\n\n\nIt’s exciting to see how teams make it their own. One group described their pathway with Star Trek analogies (which was excellent, and a great complement to Star Wars 🤓!). They plan to focus on increasing the use of R code for automating and reproducing analyses, integrating with a forthcoming centralized data management system, and focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion as they stabilize their team."

    "section": "Moving toward Open Science Together",
    "text": "Moving toward Open Science Together\nWe were absolutely blown away by the teams in this cohort and how they were thinking about open science and diversity, equity, and inclusion in their work. Some themes that emerged across the pathways include:\nSeaside Chats: Some big themes from the Champions’ Pathways were that the Seaside Chats really shine. Seaside Chats are regular meetings to talk about data – a space to identify and address shared needs and learn together, building a sense of community. Seaside Chats were where teams talked about onboarding new group members and creating the culture they want in their groups, and teams commented how they were great teaching opportunities. Seaside Chats are a powerful example of team science in action, where group members can develop technical and leadership skills and is a sustainable way for the team to continue to grow and adapt while also reducing burden on the group lead.\nOne group described how in addition to weekly lab meetings, they already have biweekly diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) meetings and found Seaside Chats focused on open/data science helpful as well, saying:\n\n\n“We didn’t know we had so much to talk about”\n\n\nWe discussed how to sustain Seaside Chat to continue skillbuilding alongside everything else, and other teams shared about setting up fun competitions to help people get comfortable using GitHub. Another team has a sign-up sheet for Seaside Chats and then whomever’s turn it is both runs the meeting but also structures the google doc, icebreakers, etc. One group was inspired by the in-person Tidy Tuesday Club at UCSB (started by 2019 Champion Allison Horst) and are thinking of starting one too.\nAnother team described how they have grown and changed physical locations during the pandemic, and that Seaside Chats have been an important way to help everyone learn together, develop shared norms, and get on the same page.\nAccessing and sharing data was a big theme. Teams want to improve data sharing within their teams and collaborators – prior to having this be publicly available in a data repository – and are looking for ways to streamline this. Following a Data Carpentries workshop, one team described forming a lasting collaboration with the instructor who they are currently working with to streamline the way they access and analyze data. They’ve been building skills and momentum through virtual “R Chats” where they lead demos and follow-alongs for their community. Their next steps include increasing the use of GitHub and RMarkdown, expanding Seaside Chats, and sharing these stories with others.\nResilient teams and kinder science: After getting an introduction to GitHub from the browser (Issues and publication) in the second Openscapes session, one team used a Carpentries Github lesson to learn and practiced how to use GitHub collaboratively for version control. We thought this was a great complement to building shared skills using existing resources.\nIt was also exciting to see the ideas we discussed in the cohort being applied to field work – this also came up in the CSU COAST Cohort that we were leading concurrently with the CS&S Cohort, and is something we hadn’t heard before – we’re interested to support this thinking.\nWe loved seeing the Nye Lab’s new website with a statement saying: “WE AIM TO USE BOTH SCIENCE AND EMPATHY to approach environmental problems by understanding the dynamics of the natural world and how they can affect people and communities” and “OPEN DATA SCIENCE is the way in which we ensure our science is as state-of-the-art, transparent, reproducible and accessible as possible.” ❤️\n\n\n\n\nTweets from @JackieMedusa and @sowasser"

Dr. Kiva Oken’s research group studies quantitative fisheries ecology and management, population dynamics, and statistical methods in ecology. As a new lab, they are looking to establish good sustainable workflows. Having dabbled a bit in open science practices like github, they are excited to learn about it more formally and implement its full potential. They also hope open science can promote more intra- and inter-lab collaboration and avoid students and staff getting silo-ed on their own individual projects, as is common in academia. They are excited to share what they learn with other groups they are part of both on and off campus. https://okenk.github.io\nKenai Watershed Forum (Soldotna, Alaska). Benjamin Meyer, Maura Schumacher, and Galen Hecht help to lead watershed research, restoration, and education about the health of the Kenai River in Alaska. Collaborating with community partners including government, private, tribal, and other non-profit groups, Kenai Watershed Forum has galvanized major improvements in ecological management in the region, helping to protect water quality and wildlife and fish habitat for current and future generations. They have generated a large volume of high quality ecological and hydrological data over the organization’s twenty-four year history and are interested in implementing reproducible and open source methods going forward. www.kenaiwatershed.org\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada. Martin Jean and Alexandra Audet’s team leads freshwater quality, sediment, wetland and macroinvertebrate monitoring for the Canadian government. They are a strong example of data science in government and from outside the USA: for almost 10 years, they have developed skills on continuous improvement and quality assurance for scientific projects, and have realized that scientists spend a lot of time on data wrangling compared to data analysis, and are looking to increasingly support them with open science. https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/freshwater-quality-monitoring\nWilliams Lab, University of South Florida. Dr. Nancy Williams’ research group studies the ocean’s role in the carbon cycle and in climate using biogeochemical sensors on autonomous vehicles, water sampling from ships, and computer model output. Over the past year of working remotely Williams has focused on building her “digital lab,” with a focus on switching her own workflow from MATLAB to Python, implementing version control and other open-science practices, and helping her students and researchers work this way too. Feeling a bit like she is reinventing the wheel and isolated, she is excited to learn about open resources and existing communities that are specifically for research groups trying to do more open science and accelerate the pace of ocean and climate research. She also sees the value in teaching these skills both to her advisees and to other students in the college so that they can maximize their own potential and feel more empowered to explore non-academic career paths. https://www.marine.usf.edu/nancy-williams\nTribes and the Exchange Network. Lydia Scheer (Program Manager for ITEP-NAU), Angie Reed (Water Resource Planner for Penobscot Indian Nation), Lisa Gover (Environmental Director for Campo Band of Mission Indians), Melinda Ronca-Battista (QA Specialist and Researcher for ITEP-NAU), and Natasha Fulton (Community Program Coordinator, ITEP-NAU) are part of the Tribes and the Exchange Network project that serves American Indian/Alaska Native government agencies and communities with the goal of building their capacity for managing the data and information they collect using digital systems and technology. They are working on solutions that are shareable, open, and scalable and can empower tribes with the information needed for reaching their environmental and natural resource management goals and objectives. Some of their team members conduct research and analysis, some work with the researchers and analysts to interpret and communicate the data and its value, and all work to bring an understanding of the benefits of sharing science-based information in balance with respecting tribal sovereignty to protect traditional knowledge. www.tribalexchangenetwork.org\nPadilla-Gamiño Lab, University of Washington. Dr. Jacqueline Padilla-Gamiño’s research group studies the effects of climate change and microplastics on the ecophysiology of marine invertebrates and seaweeds. They are an ecophysiology team working at multiple levels of biological organization, working with gene expression, physiological and ecological data from the tropics and temperate regions, as well as the study of microplastics in coral reefs and seafood. They are interested in learning how open workflows can help make their science more efficient and accessible, but even more importantly in developing a mindset and research culture that embraces collaboration and inclusion. https://padilla-gaminolab.weebly.com\nNye Lab, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). Dr. Janet Nye’s research group studies fisheries ecology and oceanography, focused on the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems. Their group of multidisciplinary chemical, biological, physical oceanographers, and ecologists all use quantitative methods to answer questions about how climate change affects marine fisheries and ecosystems. Nye’s group is literally spread across the east coast – with members from Stony Brook University, main campus UNC-CH and UNC IMS, a remote field lab in eastern North Carolina, and are seeking open science practices to collaborate and share code within the distributed groups and the wider community. https://nye.unc.edu\nWildCo, University of British Columbia. Dr. Cole Burton’s research group (the Wildlife Coexistence Lab, or WildCo) studies the applied ecology and conservation of terrestrial vertebrate biodiversity and specializes in wildlife survey tools like camera trapping. WildCo works with diverse partners to develop and apply rigorous wildlife sampling and analysis in support of improved conservation outcomes. The lab hopes to improve its capacity for leadership in open science and seeks to expand its training and influence to help increase the quality and availability of evidence to support sound decision making for wildlife management. https://wildlife.forestry.ubc.ca"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Last week Openscapes went to the RStudio Conference! This is a brief summary of a conference that truly made history, both globally as RStudio announced it is a Public Benefit Corporation, and personally for me, since it marked five years of being part of the #rstats community. It is brief (and does not begin to provide a full summary!), but will be complemented by forthcoming blogs.\n\n\n \n\nArt played a big role at the conference. A postcard by RStudio Artist in Residence Allison Horst.\n\n\n\nThe 2020 RStudio Conference (also written “RStudio::conf(2020)”) kicked off with a gorgeous video about coral reefs and the message “marine science is data science”. It was so inspiring I didn’t immediately catch what a huge deal this was: I was not at a marine biology conference, I was at a global tech conference with over 2400 attendees. Before talks about machine learning and subsetting closures, RStudio::conf(2020) started off with how critical coral reefs and oceans are to the planet, and the role data science plays in sustainability.\nBy this point I had already been at the conference for two days, teaching a workshop called R for Excel Users with Openscapesers Allison Horst, Jamie (Afflerbach) Montgomery and Jessica Couture. This workshop was a friendly intro to becoming a modern R user, full of tidyverse, RMarkdown, GitHub, collaboration & reproducibility. It was aimed for Excel users who want to add or integrate R and RStudio into their existing data analysis toolkit, with the main intent on empowering participants to continue using R after the workshop. Stay tuned for a separate blog post about the R for Excel Users workshop!\n\n\n\n\nR for Excel Users Workshop team: Julie Lowndes, Jessica Couture, Allison Horst, Jamie Montgomery.\n\n\n\nRStudio::conf(2020) felt both familiar and monumentous. It felt familiar and cozy as I chatted with #rstats friends  following Chief Scientist Hadley Wickham’s welcome, which emphasized the Code of Conduct (I wrote about the importance of setting this tone following last year’s conf). And the conference felt monumentous in a way I could not identify — until Hilary Parker and Roger Peng said in their Keynote that it had been five years since they reunited at the 2015 rOpenSci unconf and decided to start their Not So Standard Deviations podcast. I attended that rOpenSci unconf too, and thus 2020 marks five years of my involvement in the #rstats community — five years of having a more open and kinder perspective on software, collaboration, science, and life. The importance of rOpenSci and the movement it has catalyzed along with RStudio and RLadies also warrants a separate blog post, which is in the works.\n\nBut the absolute highlight of RStudio::conf(2020) was that RStudio is now a Public Benefit Corporation. This means that they “have codified our open-source mission into our charter, which means that our corporate decisions must both align with this mission, as well as balance the interests of community, customers, employees, and shareholders.” Additionally, in their charter they have an emphasized focus not only on data science, but on scientific research. JJ Allaire’s keynote announcing this news received a standing ovation. This is a huge deal; they are the first tech company to be a certified “B Corp”, and are a model in ethics and open source to other companies around the world. To me it means that they are the Patagonia of tech and I am so proud to be a part of this community. \n\n\n\n\nRStudio.com on February 4, 2020.\n\n\n\nThere were many other inspiring talks — some that I saw live and many that I will watch later online since it was impossible to see them all and all talks were recorded (and live-streamed!) and will soon be available from resources.rstudio.com (slides are now available, compiled by Emil Hvitfeldt!). Highlights included talks by Jeff Leek, Desirée De Leon, Nick Tierney, and the keynote by Jenny Bryan (links are summary Twitter threads by Julia Silge). Also, I really appreciate R for the Rest of Us’s thread highlighting content for those starting out in R.\n\n\n\n\n#rstats (and Openscapes!) friends at RStudio::conf(2020).\n\n\n\nOn the drive back home, debriefing of our experiences at RStudio::conf led to Jamie suggesting that I start my own podcast called “That Is So Great” where I interview people about what they do with R and science and ask them why It Is So Great. I am definitely into this idea, we’ll just have to see.\n\n\n  \n\nA slice of marine scientists attending RStudio::conf(2020)."

The premise was that the open source R programming language is a powerhouse for data analysis and statistics – and it also is fueling open publishing through R Markdown and a large, engaged, and innovative community. We briefly showed community-created examples of tutorials, blogs, websites, manuscripts, books, etc, and discussed how they are an entryway to open science, preprints, and open scientific publishing. This post is some reflections from the experience and summary of our slides.\nOne of the (many) things that gets us excited about R is that the same workflow you use for data analysis – that is rooted in reproducibility – empowers you make your work available to the world…in ways you never imagined.\nAs Julia said in our presentation:\nWe then introduced R Markdown, framed for scientific publishing and so much more."

    "text": "Using R Markdown beyond your wildest dreams\nUsing R Markdown also enables things you may not have thought you could create. It allows you to reimagine sharing and publishing online.\n\nCreate HTML files that can be shared openly on the web\nWe can render R Markdown to HTML. And we can store and distribute HTML files on GitHub, which also offers display options for publishing. Suddenly you can share a URL rather than attaching a file — and that same URL will update rather than re-attaching a new version of the file!\nWe shared some real-world examples from science, including examples from:\n\nThe Ocean Health Index,\nAlison Hill’s academic,\nBen Marwick’s PhD thesis template formatting for the University of Washington,\nAllison Horst’s missing explorer lesson.\n\nThese examples started with single-page HTMLs, with the ability to display floating table of contents and toggle between showing hiding code. And also simple websites that combine R Markdown files as a website with a navigation bar between pages, and requires only GitHub to display.\nWe also discussed blogdown that creates powerful websites with more complexity and blogging capabilities. This has been so important for creating blogs and tutorials to share code, discuss, and learn together. Why this important is nicely represented in this quote from the 2020 RStudio conference:\n\n\n“If you want to learn to write, you read a lot, if you want to play music, you listen a lot. It’s hard to do this with data analysis.” — Hilary Parker & Roger Peng, RStudio::conf(2020) keynote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust one example of the many open publishing options with RMarkdown.\n\n\n\nIn addition to websites, R Markdown can create bookdown books that organize and navigate html files as e-books. This is really powerful for organizing reports and documents.\nWe can also create simple slides from a single R Markdown file – imagine making a presentation and then being able to re-create presentations with updated data! Further, we can create xaringan slides that enable you to incorporate powerful styling options from within R (without requiring knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, etc).\nlearnr provides the power of interactive tutorials from a friendly website interface. This is really exciting to think about reimagining teaching and how to blend lectures and hands-on coding for learners of all levels."

    "text": "Discussion time\nAfter going through the slides, we discussed with attendees the benefits of a HTML-focussed workflow. One of the benefits of this is that by avoiding page breaks, all your figures and tables can usually be placed right where they are mentioned. Although this might seem like a small detail, avoiding page breaks actually saved you a huge amount of time and hassle. Adam Sparks discussed that one of the benefits to HTML is the ease of sharing these in a team internally - they do not have to be published online, and can be opened in any browser. The fact that they often look really snappy and polished, and can include interactive elements like maps is also a huge selling point.\nWe also discussed how pagedown provides a fresh approach to generating PDFs on the web, and were lucky to have the creator of paged.js (which powers pagedown) Adam Hyde at our chat.\nWe also discussed some alternative formats for publishing, such as JATS, a journal publishing standard for XML. We hadn’t heard of it, (and apparently that was a good thing).\nAlison Hill made an excellent point:\n\n\n“As a former scientist, I felt woefully ill-equipped when first working with HTML output. I know you all have thought a lot about this- how can we increase HTML comfort levels and fluency for new/early scientists?”\n\n\nIn response to this we discussed some of the downfalls of HTML, namely the fact that CSS is usually required to answer questions like:\n\n“How do I change the font size”\n“How do I change the font colour”, or\n“How do I create two columns of text”\n\nWhile CSS is ubiquitous, and everywhere on the web, so it can be easy to change appearances of text. It is an additional learning point for learners, and something that can tip the balance and turn people away and back to systems they know.\nSome suggestions on addressing this were:\n\nShowing students existing R Markdown HTML templates\nProviding simple CSS templates within an R Markdown file for people to use\nBuilding better tools that guide people to create their own CSS\n\nWe had another interesting question from John Chodacki:\n\n\n“What about readers/consumers? But it seems like all the cool features of auto-updating tables, etc. can bring confusion for the reader … unable to rely on stable info. Do you agree? Are there innovative ways to mitigate?”\n\n\nThis problem can arise when you generate a graphic, or a model during data analysis, and iterate on it and improve it. Later one, you might want to compare your current graphic to your first one, or your first model to the current one. However, doing that is actually pretty hard, and involves some strong version control skills. We discussed an approach that Miles McBain broached a few years ago called journalr (repo).\nUltimately, this is a hard problem to solve, and mimics a real life pen and paper notebook. Roger Peng discussed an approach to this in the NSSDeviations podcast (we believe in Episode 74), involving a manual approach.\n\n\n\nhttps://openpublishingfest.org"

    "text": "Openscapes Champions incorporate open practices in their science\nThis article was originally published on medium.com\nWe are halfway through the Openscapes Champions program, which mentors scientists and empowers them and their labs with data science and open practices and helps grow the community of practice within the lab and beyond. This week we are meeting for a summit supported by my Mozilla Fellowship and hosted at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) to strengthen relationships, share lessons learned, problem solve, and ignite new collaborations. This is a closer look at the the work of these inspiring scientists.\n\n\n  \n\n\nAt Openscapes, we champion open practices in environmental science to help uncover data-driven solutions faster. Through the Champions Program, we do this by mentoring scientists and empowering them with open data science so that they can do better science in less time and champion these practices in their communities. This means working directly with scientists on the ground and in the lab to understand their challenges and help them find solutions to their data workflows and create real change and work within their already packed schedules.\nAlthough environmental research is based on collecting, combining, analyzing complex data from multiple sources, most environmental scientists have not had formal computing and data training. Through Openscapes, Champions are learning alongside their lab members how to incorporate data science and open practices into their work, enabling their lab members, and taking their research to new heights.\nOur inaugural cohort of Champions are early career environmental scientists leading critically important research programs and dedicated to teaching the next generation of scientists.\nThe scientists we work with are at the heart of Openscapes: these are people dedicating their lives to helping find solutions to some of the most complex and ever-changing environmental challenges we face as a society. We are so thrilled to have them a part of Openscapes and wanted to share with you about them and celebrate their achievements. Here is a brief introduction to each of them, with a specific focus on their recent work since they began the Openscapes program. All labs have been working on Codes of Conduct and having internal “Seaside Chats” to discuss shared data workflows in the lab.\n\n\n  \n\nHalley Froehlich, PhD is a marine aquaculture & fisheries scientist studying global food systems and climate change. She inspires and empowers audiences of all kinds, including through Netflix’s Bill Nye saves the world.\nAs an incoming Assistant Professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, being part of Openscapes has helped Dr. Froehlich think ahead for systems she wants in place as she builds her new lab. She is designing the physical laboratory space to be open to foster conversation and collaboration, including server setups to store local to global data and lab onboarding to streamline better research practices.\nWhile participating in Openscapes, she has co-authored three publications on marine aquaculture and fisheries (see full list) and met with California legislators to discuss science, climate change, and aquaculture. She was a Keynote Speaker at the Fish Free Feed (F3) conference in February and has been invited to be the Keynote Speaker at the Pacific Coast Shellfish and National Shellfish Association Conference in September. She has also been featured in Women in Science Portrait Exhibit at the Santa Barbara MOXI museum and been interviewed twice on the Aquademia Podcast (Earth’s Got Issues and Seafood and Global Climate Change). She also wrote an upcoming feature piece in World Aquaculture Magazine to be published this month on the journey of her aquaculture research, entitled “A Global View of Aquaculture’s Future: A Journey of Interdisciplinary Science, Conservation and Sustainable Seafood”, where she highlights the importance of big data and information sharing as the future of the field.\n\n\n  \n\nAllison Horst, PhD is a data science and statistics lecturer in an environmentally-focused graduate program. Dr. Horst was awarded the student-appointed Bren School of Environmental Science & Management Distinguished Teaching Award in 2018.\nDr. Horst has leveraged Openscapes as an opportunity to learn and bring open science concepts to her courses at the University of California at Santa Barbara. She teaches students to use GitHub to version and publish their code, and has re-organized and shared her course materials online.\nDr. Horst has just finished teaching her Advanced Data Analysis course, which focuses on advanced methods in data science and emphasizes written, oral, and visual communication of complex statistical topics. Students’ final projects were to create interactive graphics using Shiny for their analyses. She is a current nominee for the 2019 campus-wide award for outstanding teaching at UCSB. Additionally, Dr. Horst is an Artist in Residence at the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis (NCEAS). Part of her focus has been to create the Openscapes logo and art for the Openscapes website and seminars (thank you Allison!), and to create statistics and coding artwork, which she shares with the #rstats community. Her work has been used around the world in teaching and presentations.\n\n\n  \n\nNishad Jayasundara, PhD is a physiologist studying organismal adaptation to their habitat and effects of external environmental factors. His ongoing research includes capacity building to address environmental health in Sri Lanka.\nA professor at the University of Maine, Openscapes has helped Dr. Jayasundara’s lab think about shared practices for documentation and reproducibility. The Jayasundara lab has complex experimental setups requiring building flow-through aquaria and raising marine and aquatic animals, and the lab has been focusing on documenting experimental design and improving metadata.\nDr. Jayasundara uses genetics, physiology, and biochemistry as tools to study chronic exposure to environmental pollutants in wildlife and humans. Recently, he has been designing and leading a project to compare the coast of Maine to uncover long term shifts in patterns from a physiology angle (inspired by a study at Hopkins Marine Station). He has been invited to a workshop in Costa Rica in March and give an seminar at MDI Biological Laboratory in April. He is also involved in the National Science Foundation’s Research Opportunities for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Maine.\n\n\n  \n\nMalin Pinsky, PhD is an ecologist studying the impacts of climate change on ocean life. With expertise on shifting habitats of ocean animals, Dr. Pinsky leads OceanAdapt, a website used by governments and NGOs for climate adaptation planning.\nDr. Pinsky is an associate professor at Rutgers University. Openscapes has been helping the Pinsky lab formalize and document their shared data practices through GitHub — with the particular aim on onboarding and offboarding members of a large, heterogeneous group and sharing data and analyses publicly and transparently.\nSince January, Dr. Pinsky has had four scientific articles published (see full publication list), one of which was covered by the New York Times and National Geographic. He has given seminars at the University of Washington and Hopkins Marine Station, and has an upcoming OCTO webinar about the effects of temperature on species distributions and community composition and marine protected area management in April.\n\n\n  \n\nAdrian Stier, PhD is a marine ecologist studying the recovery and resilience of ocean ecosystems. Included in the systems he studies are coral reefs, and he recently was a Keynote Speaker at the 4th Coral Reef Symposium.\nDr. Stier is a professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara and emphasizes teamwork in the field, in the lab, and in the office. Openscapes has been an opportunity for getting his lab using version control collaboratively on GitHub so they can all work together and increase activity in coding as a lab.\nDr. Stier has recently published an article about timing can affect biodiversity in seagrass habitats and was awarded a California SeaGrant to study how marine protected areas may promote ecosystem resilience in the face of global climate change. Prioritizing communication to diverse audiences, he also participated in a workshop with COMPASS.\n\n\n  \n\nNina Therkildsen, PhD is an evolutionary biologist using genomic analyses to improve marine conservation and fisheries management. Dr. Therkildsen studies genetic adaptation using current, historic, and ancient DNA.\nDr. Therkildsen is a professor at Cornell University, where she recently taught a course on Computational Skills for Efficient Data Processing and Analysis (inspired by pre-Openscapes discussions). Now, through Openscapes her lab is setting up shared coding workflows with GitHub.\nRecently, Dr. Therkildsen has received several grants with conservation implications for imperiled fish populations and to use DNA-based methods to examine what species aquaculture feed used in different parts of the world are made from. She is teaching Molecular Tools for Ecology, Conservation, and Resource management, and is a member of several scientific advisory boards and steering committees, including the Gloucester Marine Genomics Institute, NSF-sponsored Research Coordinated Network for Evolution in Changing Seas and the NOAA/NEFSC Atlantic Cod Stock Structure Working Group.\n\n\n  \n\nChelsea Wood, PhD is an ecologist studying marine and freshwater parasites in a changing world. Her work was recently featured in a bioGraphic video, “Protected by prawns”, by the California Academy of Sciences.\nDr. Wood, a professor at the University of Washington, has been incorporating GitHub into her analytical workflow through Openscapes. She has also reorganized the online infrastructure and file sharing for her courses to save time in future years, adopted new, reproducible and collaborative file structures for recently launched research projects, and has worked with her lab to develop a long-term vision for reproducibility in their research.\nDr. Wood’s lab is launching a new research initiative to understand long-term change in aquatic disease, and she recently published two manuscripts on the value of museum specimens for disease ecology (see full publication list). In March, she gave a department seminar at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and in April she will give the Rising Star in Ecology Lecture at University of Toronto’s Atwood Colloquium. She recently won a Western Regional Aquaculture Center grant to study a parasite that affects Pacific oysters. Additionally, Dr. Wood teaches graduate students how to study the ecology of past ecosystems rigorously and quantitatively through her Historical Ecology course at UW’s School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, which includes a field trip to the Resource Center at Seattle’s Museum of History and Industry.\n\n\nPhoto by Elliot Lowndes"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Our 7th Openscapes Community Call featured a “celebrity interview” with Monica Granados, PhD. Monica is the Open Climate Campaign Manager at Creative Commons and on the Leadership team of PREreview. She is an open science specialist and a trained ecologist. Monica was interviewed by Julie Lowndes, PhD, Openscapes Director. Watch the recording on Openscapes YouTube.\nIn this conversation, we dug into what each of us can do to connect our daily work to the climate movement. How do we connect “big problems” like climate change with “little problems” like sharing knowledge, data, different versions of files, and automating analyses & reports? We wanted to come away with concrete actions we can all weave into our daily work:\n\nIf climate is part of your day job, how to leverage open science\nIf open science is part of your day job, how to connect that to climate\n\nMonica told us about her “origin story” in open science as an ecologist and the roles some people and organizations played. She shared how an open science course through NCEAS was pivotal, and how she came home a different person telling all her friends and colleagues “Have you heard about open science?!!!”. She was transformed by the idea that this was a different way to do science - a paradigmatic shift and a new philosophy of science. One moment in particular that stood out was when Karthik Ram, founder of rOpenSci, showed Monica how she could access Daniel Pauley’s fisheries work directly from R. Mozilla Open Leaders was another part of her journey, where she deepened her mindsets and skills for “working open”.\nMonica also shared about the Open Climate Campaign - a 4-year project funded by the Arcadia Foundation to help make open sharing of resources around research the norm in climate science.\nA recurring theme throughout the conversation was breaking down problems into tasks you can contribute to. It’s not about trying to solve the huge problem - it’s about bringing in your own expertise / perspective. “We need all the big things - policy, green solutions - but go where your own expertise is.”\nAfter the interview, participants contributed to a rich conversation with questions touching on which workflows should be streamlined to reduce the time required to discover, connect, and coordinate around open science; funding models; licensing; and differences in how open science for climate is moving forward in governments, universities, and elsewhere. Collaborative notes are in our Google Doc.\n\n\n“We underestimate the power of contribution–of acting within our own sphere of influence to tackle the piece of the problem that is right in front of us.” — Abigail Dillen in Litigating in a Time of Crisis, in All We Can Save"

    "title": "Openscapes Champions Program: Fall 2021 Updates",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This Fall we have been leading three Champions Cohorts, with Fisheries Dependent Data Users (FDD), NOAA’s National Marine Fishery Service (NMFS), and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation’s Symbiosis in Aquatic Systems Initiative (SASI). We’ll share separate blog posts about each Cohort; here we wanted to focus on how we have been iterating the Champions program.\n\nThe Openscapes Champions Program is a leadership and professional development program modeled after Mozilla Open Leaders, focused on research teams, with original curriculum modeled from open data science lessons learned from the Ocean Health Index. We led 1 Champions Cohort in both 2019 and 2020; in 2021 we’ve led 6 Cohorts, learning and iterating each time. This Spring we introduced the 2-month series with NWFSC, CS&S, and CSU COAST Cohorts, working with Tara Robertson to improve our practices around diversity, equity, and inclusion, and followed up with 3-month check-ins where Champions shared and screenshared about their efforts for shared project management and onboarding new group members.\nOver the Summer we invested what we had learned from Spring cohorts back into the Champions program to prepare for the 3 Fall cohorts. The updates to Fall Champions Cohorts include:\nCohort GitHub repos - we created a GitHub repository and website for each cohort in advance (FDD, NMFS, and SASI), to serve several purposes. It was a place to post information about the cohort: times we meet and teams involved, and to showcase how to make a website from a GitHub repository. It also provided a place for Champions to work during the GitHub Clinics (which previously had been in temporary repos), and give a continued space to practice Markdown, Issues, and Projects after the clinics. We also posted summary digest following each call using Issues instead of email.\nGitHub Clinics - Teaching our GitHub Clinic as one of four cohort calls in the 2-month Cohorts felt tight in the Spring, so this fall we experimented having these Clinics as a fifth, optional, stand-alone call. We recorded it for folks that couldn’t make the additional times, and it seemed to still be impactful for participants – GitHub for project management was a big theme for the NMFS and FDD cohorts.\nGuest teachers - We invited guest teachers to share their expertise with the Cohorts, either by presenting existing curriculum or sharing something from their work within the existing themes in the Champions curriculum. This was a way to include community members, hear different stories and examples, and tailor the curriculum for different cohorts depending on the expertise of the guest teacher.\nSlack - We invited Fall Champions teams to Openscapes Slack after our first cohort call, providing each cohort with a private channel. This aligns with our approach that open science is a spectrum, and working openly with yourself, your team, and your cohort helps you build habits and confidence so you can work more openly with others when you’re ready. Fall Champions are able to interact within their private cohort channel as well as community channels to check-in between calls and share questions and resources.\nCo-working - Something we do within our team that we’ve introduced this Fall are co-working sessions where we work at the same time together via Zoom. This is different from office hours but a chance for Champions to come together and work on something with low-key accountability and community, and to talk things out and ask questions. Sometimes, this means quiet work with check-ins to break up focused work and get feedback, and sometimes this involves screensharing to problem solve.\nOnboarding Mentors - We’ve had a lot of help leading the Fall Cohorts, and are so grateful to partner mentors co-leading and assisting. We began working with and onboarding these mentors over the summer while also beginning writing the Openscapes Approach Guide to help document our process. We will have further blog posts about what we all learned and did together and are so grateful to Eli Holmes (NWFSC) and Corey Clatterbuck (California Water Boards) with the NMFS cohort, Anna Holder (California Water Boards) and Rachel Baum (UMassD Claire T. Carney Library) with the FDD cohort, and Lenny Teytelman (protocols.io) and Emma Ganley (protocols.io) with the SASI cohort!\nIt’s always great to see what topics resonate with different teams, and how they focus efforts in the interplay of software and culture; for example by using GitHub Projects as a way to strengthen collaborations between colleagues who are and aren’t yet coders, and provide a way to onboard folks if they’d like to learn more. Stay tuned for blogs sharing more details about the Fall Cohorts, and we’ll be iterating further in 2022, building from what works and experimenting further!\n  \n\nPhoto by Elliot Lowndes"

Workshops are a 2-day version of the Openscapes Champions program, and uses its Lesson Series to help scientists supercharge their research.\nParticipants attend as teams, and come prepared for engaged participation as a whole group and within smaller groups. Discussions focus around collaborative mindsets, norms, and software to enable open and collaborative work, with a heavy emphasis on R (including tidyverse, RMarkdown), GitHub (Issues), Google Drive, and Twitter. Teams intentionally have a mix of data/coding experience and responsibilities; there are no coding prerequisites for this workshop."

He reached out to me after following Openscapes on Twitter and asked if I could do a 2-day workshop version of the Champions Program. He secured workshop funding, organized everything, and rallied six local teams of awesome scientists to participate at our workshop in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.\nThe two best outcomes of the workshop were first that teams left motivated to focus on creating more deliberate, collaborative, open workflows within their team, and second, that they saw other teams as future colleagues, collaborators, and allies for fisheries open data science (!) and have plans to continue building this community.\n\n\n“Having a full two days with space to talk about how we work was invaluable. I was so pleased with how energized and engaged my team was throughout. I loved the opportunity to talk, work and learn cross-teams.” — Post-workshop survey\n\n\n\n\n\n“Openscapes had a powerful motivating impact on some of the practices of open science I already knew about but felt behind the curve on tackling. Finding fellow coworkers who are equally motivated and already implementing these practices gave me a support team to work with moving forward.” — Post-workshop survey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the workshop participants met in small groups to discuss how topics covered applied to their work. They met as semi-random Breakout Groups to cross-pollinate across teams, as well as with with their own Research Groups.\n\n\n\nAll six teams at our workshop work in the realm of fisheries science and management, and as a whole they already have quite a bit of momentum in open data science. But many of these folks hadn’t had recent discussions around shared workflows and practices within their teams or how to onboard team members, and also didn’t necessarily know people from other teams that were working on similar topics or with similar approaches."

    "text": "Reflections\nI am really pleased with how this workshop went. Since the Openscapes Champions program is about developing mindsets and habits around open data science and nurturing cultural change in science, it was designed as a five-month remote program (with low-time investment: three hours/month). With workshops, I was interested to see how much cultural change and Championing we could catalyze in just two days. And I’m convinced it worked as we’d hoped; the participants were really thoughtful and engaged and left the workshop with plans to create community within and beyond their teams.\n\n\n“This was an empowering lesson in how we can improve our workflow, communication and morale, and work towards reproducible, efficient scientific methods.” — Post-workshop survey\n\n\nThis workshop had a lot of firsts, things that were different from the previous Champions cohort:\n\nIn person, not remote.\nLocal community and research domain: all teams are focused around the same topic (fisheries management), and were local to Cape Cod/New Bedford.\nNot all teams had leads present; only 2 groups had leads present.\n\nThere were definitely things I would like to improve for next time. Most obviously for me to reduce some of the redundancy in the slide decks; such redundancy was a nice refresher/emphasis when folks were seeing them every two weeks as part of the five-month structure but was pretty repetitive over a course of two days. Also, I found myself telling rather than showing for too much of the time. When I made the slides last year for the inaugural cohort, I had fewer examples to show. But now I have so many examples from Champions and I need to showcase like I do in my conference talks, for example at FORCE11! So I’m excited to improve the course based on this experience and the feedback I’ve received.\nAdditionally, since not all teams had leads present, in the future we should focus time for teams not only to develop a plan for working with their teams about open data science, but strategies to also strengthen buy-in from leads. This is something that we should do regardless of whether team leads are present, really.\nThank you again to everyone who participated and are now Openscapes Champions!\n\n \n\nPhoto by Alicia Miller."

    "text": "*Cross-posted at Mozilla\nOur final Openscapes Community Call of 2021 was a very special chat about open leadership with Abby Cabunoc Mayes and Chad Sansing and others now leading their own programs modeled after Mozilla Open Leaders (OL). The recording is onOpenscapes YouTube.\nAbby leads Mozilla’s developer-focused trustworthy AI strategy around MozFest and open source. Abby founded Mozilla Open Leaders and works to make openness the norm research and innovation. Chad is a program manager on the MozFest team at Mozilla. He works on facilitation, leadership, and movement-building with Mozilla’s internet health and trustworthy AI communities. Abby and Chad led the Mozilla Open Leaders program through 7+ cohorts and are some of the most impactful people we know in the open movement.\nOur conversation with Abby and Chad started with the original design and creation of Mozilla Open Leaders - what need Abby saw that led to its creation - the spark. As lead developer at the Mozilla Science Lab, Abby saw a need to help scientists and developers work openly together. This led to the first working open workshop to meet the needs of scientists working more openly together. Influenced by a startup accelerator in Toronto, the workshop was followed by 3 months of 1:1 mentorship and hands-on work during the Global Sprint with Abby and Aurelia Moser as mentors. With the next iteration of this program, the audience expanded to groups interested in open hardware, open education, open arts. The idea of multipliers and returner roles was intriguing and past graduates returned as mentors to learn-by-teaching and Abby started building these into the OL program design. Some of this iteration is captured in the first parts of the timeline found at the bottom of the ScienceLab MozillaWiki, and here are more of the resources Abby,Chad, and many others created through time:\n\nOpen Leadership Training Series\nOpen Leadership Framework\nWork Open, Lead Open (#WOLO)\nMovement building from home\nBiased by Default: Exploring Discrimination in Research Code\n\nWe talked about how Abby and Chad approach engagement and let go of ownership, as well as the tension between open & freely available but not invisible labor and lack of attribution. Abby and Chad were mindful up front to be sure that they weren’t being extractive/exploitative. Abby said she continually checks in with herself on what limits she can place on the work done by volunteers to make it worthwhile for them - what is the value exchange? Another important point is not locking people in - set commitments for period of time - and make it easy for people to leave.\nAbby and Chad also spoke about their work since Moz OL and what they’ve learned that they’d bring into OL if they had the chance. Their responses included anti-oppression frameworks, community governance (more models and more guidance), a “matrix” of engagement instead of mountain of engagement. They also counseled to be patient as things change. And to help people help you: if people want to help, that’s a big deal. Help them help - find ways to say “yes” and fewer ways to say no. People showing up anytime, but especially now, is a big deal, and having ways for folks to engage is important.\nWe also had brief share-outs by communities built on the OL model: Open Life Science (Malvika Sharan & Yo Yehudi), Open Hardware (André Maia Chagas), Open Post-Academics (Beth Duckles, Borhane Blili-Hamelin), and PREreview Open Reviewers (Daniela Saderi). Groups shared what they have done and iterated since working with Abby and Chad during OLx - a program to help groups take the OL model and apply it to their own communities. This was a wonderful celebration of Abby and Chad’s leadership and impact, and teams shared how much the design and implementation of OL is impacting researchers all over the world. One piece that stood out is the power of live google doc’ing and how this has spread across many different researcher groups. Through Openscapes we hear about it being used now in high-level NOAA Fisheries meetings, in academia, and specifically (calling out Gavin Fay here): it was something that helped transition to remote work during the first lockdown. And since this Community Call, we’ve also heard that live google-docing - and in particular sharing a parent folder so that all docs are organized for everyone in the same way - is being used being used by climate assessment working groups as well (calling out Halley Froehlich here).\nSome final thoughts: Be sure to join us for MozFest 2022 and check out the MozFest Trustworthy AI Working Groups - there’s still plenty of time to get involved to this round. And check out https://theopenorganization.org/definition/open-leadership-definition and Abby’s Year in Review 2021!\nThank you Abby, Chad, and all open leaders and supporters!

    "title": "Identifying common approaches and needs for fisheries dependent data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In September-October, Openscapes led a 2-month Champions Cohort with Fisheries Dependent Data (FDD) Users, with over 30 fisheries scientists across academia and NOAA. These scientists were interested in exploring new approaches to working with FDD, which represents a complex mix of data and information collected to facilitate managing the region’s living marine resources. In the US Northeast, data flow from individual businesses and/or scientific samplers to the region’s scientific and management organizations. This web of data and information can be difficult to access as much of the content is confidential in its raw form. Further, many of the codes and systems used to store these data can be poorly documented, and even routine analyses are not commonly shared among data users. The FDD Openscapes Cohort was interested in learning ways to explore the potential to leverage FDD in new and innovative ways. It was part of ongoing efforts to provide access, documentation, and cultivate a community of practice that focuses on using these data and associated resources to their full potential.\nThis post focuses on what the cohort setup and participants achieved. It is co-authored with Gavin Fay (UMass Dartmouth) and Andy Jones (NEFSC), who coordinated the cohort, and Anna Holder from California Waterboards, who assisted. This opportunity is funded through NOAA Fisheries Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) and a grant from theFisheries Information System Program through an award toUMass Dartmouth-SMAST throughCINAR. See openscapes.org/champions for more background on the Champions program.\nQuick links:"

    "text": "FDD cohort setup and structure\nWe worked with Gavin Fay in 2020 when his team were Champions in the NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) Cohort, and the Fay Lab has since shared their experience, created the inspirational (and oft borrowed and remixed) FayLab Manual while practicing and teaching open data science. Gavin and Andy brought together research teams from academia and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in the US Northeast to participate in the FDD Cohort. We iterated the Champions program based on what we learned from leading three cohorts in the spring, as we described in a separate post about Fall Cohorts. This was an exciting opportunity to host a cohort that were all focused on similar data and research questions.\nDuring our four cohort calls, the entire cohort discussed what worked and didn’t work for their FDD workflows. Each cohort call included a welcome and code of conduct reminder, two teaching sessions with time for reflection in small groups or silent journaling and group discussion before closing with suggestions for team meeting topics before next time (“Seaside Chats”), Efficiency Tips, and Inclusion Tips.\nTwo guest teachers shared about their open data science efforts relevant for FDD audiences. Kim Bastille (NOAA NEFSC) shared about the State of the Ecosystem Product Development Workflow, and described an R package called ecodata that her team created that automates data processing, data sharing, data visualization. Ileana Fenwick (University of North Carolina) taught Data strategies for Future Us, describing data organization in spreadsheets, good enough practices for data management, and tidy data. Both Kim and Ileana are Champions from previous Champions Cohorts (Kim from 2020 NEFSC Cohort and Ileana from the 2021 CS&S Cohort), and it was exciting for them to share not only their expertise through their lessons, but also their experiences learning these tools and workflows with their teams, and what they had done since their Openscapes Cohorts.\n\n\n\n\nThe State of the Ecosystem workflow tree, by Kim Bastille. Kim shared the metaphor of an apple tree when describing their workflow (roots are contributor data, the tree trunk is their ecodata R package, and the branches, leaves, and apples are the final products. Although final products (apples) may be varied, the workflows stay the same."

    "title": "Identifying common approaches and needs for fisheries dependent data",
    "section": "What did the participants achieve?",
    "text": "What did the participants achieve?\nThis was an exciting cohort because participants were focused on a common topic: research using FDD data. We had both data users (largely academic) and data providers (NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center) in the Cohort, and they were able to share common issues and approaches that could benefit others in the group. Many topics/themes that resonated with the 2021 FDD Cohort overlapped and reinforced each other. Here are a few examples.\nSharing data isn’t the only way to practice open science. Many aspects of FDD can be confidential, meaning that it cannot be shared publicly or has special considerations for sharing. We discussed how there are ways to be open and collaborative even if you can’t share the data itself. For example, sharing documentation and metadata is a way to be open and collaborative, even if you cannot share the data. Making knitted (RMarkdown) documents that show data summaries even when raw data can’t be accessed is another strategy. Another approach is to provide a “toy” or simulated dataset with all the right fields so that code can be developed, then shared with a partner who has access to the confidential data and can run the code on their own. Further, location data can be jittered, vessel IDs can be anonymized, and data can be collapsed or summarized in a way to protect the confidential aspects of the dataset before sharing it broadly. We also discussed different definitions and examples of confidential data, and how folks treat it differently within an agency, and outwardly for users. Do we all agree on what confidential data actually is? Does everyone know how to handle confidential data properly?\nPsychological safety. When we discussed the importance of psychological safety, participants had great ideas for how to help foster more trust and safety in teams. For example, instead of “do you have any questions?” asking “what questions do you have?”, and creating spaces where individuals can be vulnerable to role model and encourage group vulnerability and trust. The cohort emphasized and reiterated that building trust and vulnerability takes time; it is built/earned through little moments and actions, not given outright - and it’s important for those that hold power (PIs, supervisors, managers, etc.) to lead by example and make space for those little moments within their teams. Others noted how important psychological safety was in this area where often data sets are not well documented and communication is essential to the proper use of the data.\nTooling helped teams collaborate - but Github and Slack are not the only options! Utilizing tools like Slack and GitHub can help some teams streamline and advance their communication and collaboration workflows, but that doesn’t mean those specific tools will work for everyone. Some individuals and teams in the FDD Cohort were already avid R/GitHub users, others were interested in using those tools more (GitHub Projects, and Issues, anyone?), and some individuals were not as keen on embedding a whole new software like GitHub or Slack into their workflows. Regardless of any individual’s interest or current abilities with a certain tool, everyone was able to use the Openscapes mindset to think about tools and workflows they currently use, explore how they are serving their teams (or not), and brainstorm ways to improve their data and communication workflows independent of any specific tool. Some teams in the FDD cohort regularly work with partners that may not have access to such tools, or even have access to the Internet. Teams began to discuss what to do in those situations and used their Seaside Chats to brainstorm and find solutions that work for them.\nCode of Conduct for Data? In our final session one group shared that with their Pathway they had thought a lot about codes of conduct, and how they could be used to be more clear about how to work with data, data access, and acknowledging contributors across multiple institutions. Other groups agreed, thinking that this could be another form of metadata that would be very helpful to refer to before, during, and after the project. It could also help streamline onboarding of team members as they enter projects, and offboarding team members before they move on. The question of “Who owns the data?”, from principles of anti-colonial science, was an important framing, and folks recommended viewing the recording of Dr. Max Liboiron’s recent keynote about research, communication, and land relations.\nCodes of conduct and other types of transparent documentation are important for external partners or the public - just as they are for future us as individuals, as teams, and as organizations. Developing codes of conduct resonated with the FDD cohort because they could be used as a way to be explicit about team or organization’s values (like psychological safety, diversity, equity, and inclusion) and standardize a way to document the metadata associated with how we work (where to find data, how to organize and use it, what can be shared, what should remain confidential, etc.)\nWe loved working and learning with this cohort of fisheries scientists and exploring the challenges they face. The following is a bit more about each team; look out for further blogs about what the Openscapes team learned and what’s coming next."

    "text": "FDD Cohort teams\nThe Cadrin team at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth is a collaboration among academic, federal and state scientists as well as people in the groundfish fishing industry to develop standardized indices of groundfish stock abundance by managing and analyzing fishery monitoring data. There are several data streams and alternative modeling approaches that would benefit from the Openscapes program for efficiency, transparency and reproducibility to produce the best scientific information available to assess and manage fisheries.\nThe Humphries team at the University of Rhode Island uses a combination of field experiments, underwater surveys, and interviews to study fish and fisheries. Their goal is to link ecological interactions with social dynamics in order to evaluate and prioritize management solutions.\nThe Hyde team has multiple members from NEFSC, GARFO, academia and industry. Currently all work is being done by individuals, but they are hoping Openscapes will help them improve collaboration and make their work more transparent for the public.\nThe Mills team is leading novel research projects that strive to develop models to meet the complex challenges facing marine ecosystems, fisheries, and coastal communities. They are continually working to improve our quantitative capabilities by including more spatial and temporal data at finer resolutions, combining quantitative and qualitative information to make the best use of available data, and developing more sophisticated modeling frameworks that can accommodate complex data, such as fisheries dependent data. We hope that the skills we learn will advance our abilities such that our questions, and in turn the impact of our findings, are not constrained by technological limitations.\nThe Selden team is composed of members from diverse backgrounds, including graduate students, professors, and individuals who work at non-profits. They have research backgrounds in geography, ecology, and oceanography and have mastered how to talk across these disciplines, and are now analyzing how fishing communities have responded to past, and present distribution shifts of target species and creating an index of vulnerability to future climate change.\nThe Stoll team is interested in the human dimensions of fisheries and ocean systems and how policies and practices shape people’s interactions with the marine environment. This focus means that they tend to engage with FDD in unconventional ways that both present challenges and also create opportunities to further our knowledge about fisheries and the people who depend on them for food and livelihood. The goal of participating in the Champions cohort is to both improve our research skills and (long-term) to help institutionalize open data science.\nThe Fay team focuses on developing interdisciplinary modelling approaches to extend the scope of applications for fisheries and ecosystem assessment methods, and testing the performance of decision support tools for living marine resource management. They apply a range of statistical and modelling approaches for the assessment and management of fish, marine mammal, and marine reptile populations, and actively collaborate with academic and agency scientists in the Northeast US, US West Coast, Australia, and Europe.\nThe Jones/NEFSC team in part collects FDD in collaboration with the fishing industry, which can be underutilized, in part due to the complex nature and challenges creating reproducible research products. They are interested in strengthening open science approaches to increase the value of these data by opening the door to new users who have previously been unable to use the data sets due to their complex nature.\n \n\nThe SOE apple tree presented by Kim Bastille."

    "text": "In May 2023 we launched a 3-week program called Openscapes Reflections Program that we had been designing together from the beginning of the year. This program blends professional leadership coaching skills with open data science principles to help people identify and plan around their workflow needs. The purpose was to offer light-weight opportunities for folks interested in the Champions program, wanting a refresher or to onboard others to open data science, or as follow-up opportunities for the Pathways to Open Science program (also launched this year by Ileana Fenwick supporting Black marine and environmental researchers). Unlike the Champions Program, Reflections is something that folks can sign up for as individuals.\nRead below about what the participants and we learned from this experience, and look out in early 2024 to sign up – we’ll lead the Reflections Program again in Spring 2024.\nThis is how one participant described the Reflections Program, and this was our intent – to help people think through how they’re doing and what they need in terms of their workflows. We designed Reflections to be rewarding for people who haven’t been part of Openscapes initiatives so far, as well as returning folks who want some accountability and space to reflect on their workflows and plan how open data science practices can fuel institutional culture change. We wanted to create a space for us all to get a little less stuck in our daily workflows (folders full of files with names like “Report_with_figuresFINAL_v2.doc” anyone?) so we can redirect our energy to the part of our work that we care about, connected to our values for climate change and social justice. The Reflections Program is intentionally light-weight, and primarily asynchronous with 3 optional Huddles via Zoom where we had dedicated time to reflect on the prompts and discuss and give example tooling for our workflows."

    "text": "What we learned\nThrough our experience with Openscapes Champions teams, we learned that folks need to reflect on their own workflows in order to talk about them with their colleagues and identify what is working and where they have needs. Isolating this reflection as a way to help folks orient was an experiment, identified as something that could work by our colleague Erin Robinson. And, we are happy that this was useful for participants! We will be offering it annually, iterating from suggestions from participants.\nWe learned some things that we’ll do differently next time. First, in trying to be light-weight, we refrained from doing some of our practices that we do for Champions and Mentors cohorts, and learned that people wanted them! This includes: sending Calendar invites with Zoom links for the Optional Huddles. Since they were optional, we didn’t want to flood inboxes; however this is something that ultimately saves more people time. We’ll also create a certificate of completion for participants (we plan to ultimately make this with the kyber R package, as something that we can also use in the Champions Program).\nWe’ll also think about how to iterate with the structure of the hour-long huddles. We split time between a short intro with slides, time to reflect as we say the prompts out loud, and open discussion with the group. We like a balance of reflection time with music, since there is no expectation folks have already allotted time to this before coming. The feedback was that people appreciated this when they hadn’t had time to reflect beforehand. Other feedback was wanting more time to discuss, since it’s an opportunity to have such expertise together in the room. We think all three of these elements are important, and will iterate on the balance of these three in future iterations.\nWe’ll announce the Spring 2024 Reflections program in early 2024! Until then, you can reflect with our open resources on your own or with your team: all the prompts are listed in the Reflections Booklet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Elliot Lowndes"

We are just wrapping up Year 1 and amazed at how much we have collectively accomplished this year with the DAAC mentors and participating DAACs as well as all the researchers and research teams we have worked with. You can read more about our first year in our 2021 annual report. \nAs part of this work, with the DAAC mentors, we co-led our first NASA Openscapes Champions cohort. Based on Openscapes’ flagship program, Openscapes Champions, theNASA Openscapes Champions Cohort was a professional development and mentorship opportunity for early adopter, science teams that use NASA Earthdata and were interested in migrating their existing workflows to the cloud through collaborative open data science practices. The Openscapes Champions Cohort ran formally in March - April 2022. \nThe ten research teams who participated were interested in a wide variety of NASA Earthdata and various stages of cloud technology familiarity. You can learn more about their research below. Together as a Champions cohort they discussed what worked and didn’t work as they migrated workflows to the cloud, with a focus on collaboration and open science. We met as a cohort five times over two months, on alternating Fridays. Each cohort call included a welcome and code of conduct reminder, two teaching sessions with time for reflection in small groups or silent journaling and group discussion, before closing with suggestions for future team meeting topics (“Seaside Chats”), Efficiency Tips, and Inclusion Tips. Additional hands-on clinics and coworking sessions were scheduled within this period and will extend for the next two months to support these teams as they continue to work on the cloud workflow migration. In addition, the teams were supported by the Openscapes DAAC mentors and staff and Element84 and had access to Openscapes’ 2i2c Jupyter Hub, which will continue for the next year.\n\n\n\n\nClass photo of NASA Champions."

    "text": "What did participants achieve?\nJust like our DAAC mentors have built collaborative bridges across the distributed data centers to identify the common parts of cloud data access over the first year of our project, this cohort was an opportunity to connect NASA Earthdata users, building a community that is eager to use data in the cloud and provides a forum to discuss common techniques and challenges. The teams devoted at least 8 hours a month to focus on their workflows. In this time, they thought through and discussed their current NASA Earthdata workflows and planned and experimented with transitioning their workflows to the cloud using Openscapes’ 2i2c-hosted Jupyter Hub as a first step. As in other Openscapes Champions cohorts, teams also realized the power of onboarding to create more resilient labs and they explored creating collaborative spaces for their teams through Google Drive, Slack, and GitHub. \nThemes we revisited throughout the cohort included: \nThe Open science underpinnings of the Openscapes Champions program are important. During our last Champions session when the teams presented their pathways, it was amazing to hear how many times that teams were trying to use Github, Gitlab, or taking away other Open science practices in addition to the cloud-specific. It wasn’t all or nothing, they were taking small steps. It was also great to hear that a takeaway from this cohort is, working more openly and reproducibly provides for a more resilient workflow and team. \nWe intentionally focus on providing a kind welcome to technical topics. The kind space that we co-created with the teams and DAAC mentors provided an opportunity to collaborate as teams and ask questions that may in other settings go unasked because of fear that everyone else already knows. (Note: everyone else doesn’t know and will be glad you asked!)   \nThis also led to several challenges that consistently surfaced and still need more focused effort to resolve. The vocabulary to understand the Cloud needs to be clearly explained. For example, what is an S3 bucket or a “requester pays bucket” and why does a user need to know about AWS West-2? Cloud cost is another challenge. We lower the barrier by providing the 2i2c Jupyterhub, but teams don’t want to depend on our hub. They want their own workspace and want to be able to predict costs more effectively. Finally, our work has been focused on Python because that was the language of choice for DAAC mentors and it is a widely used open-source language in the broader Earth science community. In the Champions Cohort we had three teams using Matlab and one team using R; we need to think about how to expand our support and tutorial materials for these other languages."

We are moving from the structured sessions of the Champions program into two additional months of coworking time and 1-1 interactions with DAAC mentors and staff and Element84 in order to make lasting changes with cloud data access. \nWe will focus on specific topics like: \n\nPracticing GitHub workflows and teaching others on your team \nCloud spatial subsetting \nEnvironment management for creating cloud computing space that is reproducible and scalable (e.g. docker images) \nDask/Pangeo software stack to enable scalable processing \nCloud costs and setup \nNetCDF to Zarr\nDocker containers \n\nFinally, we are grateful to this Champion Cohort’s early adopter spirit, their time and effort to make this migration, and all of the feedback and input they provided. They all participated in this cohort knowing that they were some of the first research teams to use NASA Earthdata in the cloud and that they were the first NASA Openscapes Champions cohort. This meant that there would be technical challenges as we work out migrating to the cloud, yet what they learn will make it easier for subsequent teams making this same shift. It also exhibited the reciprocal learning that happens; we will refine the NASA Openscapes Champions as we plan for our next cohort and our work with the DAAC mentors in year 2."

Nearly all of our projects use Landsat imagery to map changes in glacier, iceberg, and/or snow extent. Several projects also use Landsat data to map glacier velocities or rely on NASA-produced glacier velocities computed from Landsat and Sentinel-2 data.

Fetching from aggregations (THREDDS, GDS) works for case studies, but sometimes we need to process it all (simplest example: make a multi-year climatology, to give context to actual fields as “anomalies”). So the data lake in the cloud will be a nice resource, and open new vistas like machine learning which always benefits from more data.\nThe Cornillon Team at the University of Rhode Island has several projects making use of MODIS and VIIRS sea surface temperature (SST). The project of focus for this cohort has been the statistical description of the location, strength, and temporal evolution of SST fronts. As part of this project, we developed an algorithm to unmask pixels improperly flagged as cloud contaminated in the standard MODIS SST products. The improved masks will be made available to the community at large as will the fronts identified by our edge detection algorithm. \nThe Ladies of Landsat Team has members from USGS, UCSB, and the University of Arizona. Kate uses dense time series of Landsat data to build harmonic models to predict land use cover and land use change and its links to climatological signals. Crista and Sarah research the human dimensions of earth observation data, such as Landsat. Nikki uses NASA drought models to map climate hazards in her Navajo Nation community. The research project “Power of the Pixel: Connecting Indigenous Communities through Remote Sensing in the United States” combines the power of all three foci to use NASA/USGS Landsat data to build earth observation capacity in Indigenous communities across the United States.\nThe SASSIE Team has members from the University of Washington, JPL, and APL. They are part of the NASA salinity and SWOT science teams, and regularly use satellite salinity, temperature, altimetry and sea ice data, as well as in situ holdings (SPURS-2, upcoming SASSIE experiment).\nThe Tandon Team at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth uses remotely sensed data to setup the larger scale perspectives for our more in depth analysis and cruise based work for in-situ experimental data from initiatives in the Indian Ocean such as ASIRI and MISOBOB.\nThe Palter Team at the University of Rhode Island uses NASA data to compare with in-situ observations taken from ships and Uncrewed Surface Vehicles. NASA data provides additional parameters (like ocean surface topography) that are useful in the understanding of in-situ data (for example identifying fronts in the ACC). We have also used ocean color data from MODIS-Aqua to map distributions of ocean surface properties, such as chlorophyll concentration & sea surface salinity (region-specific algorithm), to analyze seasonal, annual, and decadal trends of key biogeochemical processes in the ocean.\nThe Just Team at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai uses earth observations to reconstruct ground-level environmental exposures to fine particulate matter, air temperature, and humidity which we use in epidemiologic health studies with cohorts and large registries in the US and Mexico. In a project that started out by seeking to understand the pattern of error in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrievals, we have developed an R-based reproducible workflow using the targets package for collocating and correcting AOD from the MAIAC algorithm (product MCD19A2 for Aqua and Terra) versus ground stations using gradient-boosted machine learning. This workflow adds reproducibility and extensibility for further development and new applications, building on results we have published for AOD (https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10050803) and for column water vapor (https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-4669-2020; data/code in Zenodo: 10.5281/zenodo.3568449).\nThe Hain/SPoRT Team is a directly funded NASA activity and engages with operational stakeholders to transition unique NASA observations and capabilities to improve decision-making.\nThe Roberts Team supports evaluation of global energy and water budgets, develops retrieval algorithms and climate data records (e.g. SeaFlux V1), evaluates air-sea interaction and ocean winds, and downscales and bias corrects models for use in hydrologic and agricultural modeling)."

    "text": "February through May 2023, Openscapes Mentors from across governments and academia came together for some hands-on learning and practice that had a profound effect on the way we will teach and lead going forward. We learned coaching skills that can help us as professionals – skills like listening rather than solutioneering, asking open-ended questions that empower people to find their own agency and meet their needs. This is a program designed and facilitated by Tara Robertson, a Certified Professional Co-Active and International Coaching Federation Associate Certified Coach. Openscapes has been developing a professional collaborative relationship with Tara since 2021. It was also impactful because it brought together Openscapes Mentors from across government groups (NASA Earthdata, NOAA Fisheries, EPA, California Waterboard) so they can learn together and support each other in the 2023 Year of Open Science.\nThis program had a profound impact on the three of us too, as participants as well as program designers and facilitators. We are still trying to define what it was about the program, the process, and everyone involved that led to such a profound sense of trust among us so that we were able to be vulnerable and do courageous things. While these Openscapes Mentors have been collaborating as colleagues together within their organizations (e.g. as NASA Earthdata Mentors or Pathways to Open Science Mentors), this was the first time most of these folks met as a cross-Openscapes mentor community (besides brief encounters at virtual ESIP conference sessions in 2023 and 2022).\nThis truly was a cohort of early adopter “bright spots” - folks who wanted to be better mentors and grow as leaders, even if we didn’t know what that meant yet. Not only were folks working across organizations with other mentors they didn’t know, they were expert scientists being asked to step way outside their comfort zone and be novices. In this setting, they were enthusiastic and fearless learners. There was a really high rate of participation and very few people dropped off over the six sessions. We saw individual growth and impacts feeding back and forth: something introduced gently here that we can practice together makes us comfortable, and now we can take this to other spaces and introduce it gently to others too."

    "text": "Designing a courageous space\nWe connected these bright spots by creating space and place. We met every 2 weeks for 6 remote sessions for a total of 12 hours. Twenty-eight people participated as part of their paid jobs, supported by their organizations rather than doing it “off the side of their desk”. We used a practice already familiar to all Openscapes Mentors: collaborative note-taking Agendas all in one Google doc where we had a shared responsibility to take notes, clarify explanations, add links to resources, and add shared joy and encouragement via emojis, +1’s and comments. We co-designed and helped each other when facilitating, which was instrumental when Tara got sick and lost her voice and Julie stepped in to facilitate the session based on Tara’s prep ahead of time.\nThe 6 sessions focused on specific topics: powerful questions, 3 levels of listening, identifying values, leader within, saboteurs and then taking these coaching skills into mentoring, supervising and sponsoring. For each of the topics, Tara briefly described the topic or skill, did a live demo with one of the participants, and the group described what they observed. Then, Tara gave us a topic to coach on, or some guardrails, and participants went into breakout rooms in pairs to practice coaching and being coached.\nThere was a lot of hands-on doing. Most of the participants said this was the best part of the course and also the most uncomfortable bit. In these pairs, the coaches were learning how to ask questions that help people open up…and this also challenged the coachees, who really dived into their needs and blockers for how to better support open science. It was also a testament to Tara’s own willingness to be vulnerable, demonstrating as a coachee and giving us her own real-life examples.\nThoughts from Tara: Something really special happened with this cohort. There were three main ingredients to this magic:\n\nThe participants were enthusiastic and fearless learners who were willing to step outside their comfort zones and learn new things together. This group of expert scientists from different organizations were willing to be beginner learners with each other. This group embodied courage.\nWe were intentional in the design to maximize psychological safety. At the start of Week 1 we designed an alliance together on how we wanted to be and learn together. I ordered the topics to start with the lower stakes topics and we were intentional about mixing people up across organizations. In the week 5 coaching demo one of the coaching demos the coachee chose to be quite vulnerable and bring a real challenge. This was a turning point where we saw that we can use these skills to surface challenging topics and have honest conversations about barriers in science.\nOpenscapes investment in coaching skills was a unique way to collectively learn some new skills AND build connections between open science leaders across different organizations and Openscapes initiatives: Mentors at NOAA Fisheries, NASA and from the growing Mentor community from CalEPA and Pathways to Open Science."

    "text": "Building skills for listening not solutioneering\nSo called “soft skills” are anything but. This was hard. Learning to ask open ended questions was hard, and what was harder still was listening to be able to ask the next powerful question. How we listen differs whether we are in mentor-mode or coach-mode:\n\nWhen we listen as mentors, we’re trying to understand where our expertise can help someone solve a problem.\nWhen we’re listening as coaches, we’re trying to help the other person define their problem, and tap into their own wisdom to find their solution, likely outside of our domain expertise.\n\nWhat do we mean by a “powerful question”? It’s a short question that can open up a really powerful conversation. It’s open-ended, usually starts with the word “What”, ideally is 5 words or less, and can’t be answered by yes or no. What feels like success to you? What’s in the way? What, if anything, is going unsaid? Which of your core values is being messed with?\nDistinguishing when we’re listening as mentors and when we’re listening as coaches is important, because it determines how we will respond as early adopters who may not know the answer to the question – think cloud computing, how to store increasingly large data, how to give hard feedback to a superior, and how to ask for help in a culture built on competition and the myth of the lone genius. Developing these coach listening skills, including what questions to ask, has helped us help others better (and notice and avoid solutioneering!). It’s also helped us feel less overwhelmed as we learn that it’s okay to not always have the answer!\n\n\n“We need these coaching skills to do powerful work and inspire meaningful connections; this program is a safe space to learn, to challenge our preconceptions, to practice, and to grow. I found it to be so invaluable because it’s a chance to acknowledge and learn about skills that are often unspoken in their ability to improve mentorship and collaboration.” — Ileana Fenwick\n\n\nThoughts from Stef. During the first two sessions, in the breakout rooms to practice coaching in pairs, I defaulted to talking more about the process and how we felt about it because actually practicing coaching, even with specific prompts, felt really really hard. But somehow over time, it got easier. Now I find myself trying out “powerful questions” with my peers in one-to-one conversations or coworking, rather than my usual behavior of suggesting solutions to people’s challenges. And people seem to respond!\nBut what really made this work?\n\nPeople were primed for this based on their prior experiences as Openscapes Mentors. They came expecting a familiar set of norms and psychological safety that allowed them first to get comfortable and then to take risks. With this foundation, together we were able to build trust early on. This is key to developing healthy teams and communities. We all knew it would be worth it even if we didn’t know what we were getting into.\nOften, to offer a program like this, an organization might contract an external professional to deliver it. We took it a step further. Openscapes contracted Tara, with whom we’ve collaborated before, and who is highly respected for her tell-it-like-it-is approach to diversity and inclusion. The core team of Tara, Julie, and me, worked to onboard ourselves and each other to this process using an open facilitation approach rather than working behind a curtain. We met frequently and defined our roles together, agreeing to role-model transparency and vulnerability and to name these things. Julie and I took turns managing breakout rooms each week so we could also take turns practicing coaching.\nThe mentors were not our students; they’re our peers and collaborators. Once people opted in, there was no judgment or “sorries” if someone was late or had to miss a session because of life’s responsibilities.\nPractice! We moved away from analyzing and into the doing. It was uncomfortable and people still came and showed up as leaders"

    "text": "Building mindsets as leaders\nDeveloping coaching skills also helped us build new mindsets. There was a braveness that grew throughout our time together that showed up in different ways. One person shared that they are more brave with whom/when/where they might interact as a coach and mentor. They had recently found themselves in-person with someone senior and rather than making nervous small talk found themselves asking powerful questions and really connecting with the senior person more, and felt that they both learned something in this short moment together.\nWe grew these new mindsets with our peers and built trust and community in a really profound way. The topics people surfaced and shared were so vulnerable – navigating racism, personal and structural saboteurs, and the integrations of personal and work life. We had never experienced such vulnerability in our work, and knew we could not shy away from difficult topics but needed to dig further and out based on the courage and trust in the room.\nThoughts from Julie. I’ve talked a lot about the impact of open data science on my career and my life. My science thinking was transformed when I realized I could do an analysis just as easily 100 times with a for-loop as doing it twice, and that I could publish my work via RMarkdown and GitHub to the open web and share via a single URL instead of sending followup emails with different versions of the same PDF or Word doc. Now, I am realizing that the impact of coaching on my thinking might be at this same level. I am still processing it all, but I am feeling more confident in places I have been struggling to show up as my full self. It is somehow helping me bring confidence into a room with me, knowing that I have new skills and a strengthened sense of shared braveness together with this cohort. When we first planned this cohort with Tara, this was new terrain. We asked ourselves, “If this is wildly successful what are the outcomes? What’s possible?“ Here are some ideas we laid out, and I think the Mentors are meeting each one:\n\nPeople model inclusive behavior in work, life, Openscapes, and our home organizations, to influence culture change\nPeople are braver, share stories and energy at work and other places\nSomeone speaks up in a meeting\nEveryone learns something new! (me too!)\nWe listen better/differently\nWe scale participation - use coaching strategies to empower others sooner, so that existing mentors don’t burn out\nMore people feel safe in Openscapes and open science, and in turn, inspire others to be braver"

    "text": "Fearless in service of something\nWorking with Tara and bringing Openscapes Mentors across different organizations and initiatives is part of movement building with our Flywheel. This is a concept developed by Jim Collins that we adapted for Openscapes with Erin Robinson (Erin first brought coaching into Openscapes strategy and practices too!). Transformations occur from relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel that builds momentum over time. Using this model, we welcomed folks to opt in, created space and place so we could invest in learning and trust, and then worked openly together as we practiced as coaches and coachees, leveraging common experiences and skills. This turn of the flywheel is part of building the momentum of kinder and open science, building from past, parallel, and collaborative work from many places. Mentors are already inspiring others with their leadership, pushing the next turn of the flywheel.\nBravery has come up throughout this cohort and this post, and this braveness and fearlessness is in service of something. We’re wanting to connect our daily work with the global moment at hand, so we can better address issues stemming from climate change and social justice. As one participant said, “I don’t want to be scared to ask questions anymore”. We want to ask questions with no ego, in rooms with our science peers. We want to break the silences, opening up the rooms so that the next person who has a question but was not sure they would voice it is empowered to speak up.\nIn our final session we paired up to coach each other through developing our own statement of purpose in open science.\n\n\n“I am an elevator to a better tomorrow”\n\n\n\n\n\n“I am a pollinator who connects people to each other and ideas so everyone flourishes”\n\n\n\n\n\n“I am the momentum that answers to my peers”\n\n\n\nWe are all the momentum that answers to our peers. To make meaningful change, we must work across all levels and elevate those who will be the change along with us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Elliot Lowndes"

We are a mix of graduate and undergraduate students under the guidance of Dr. Cheryl Logan, and we’re focused on evaluating the physiological responses of marine fish and invertebrates to the current and predicted effects of climate change. Many of our projects rely on analyzing large environmental, physiological, or genomic datasets but most of us do not have formal training in data science.\n\n\n \n\nThe Logan Lab at California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB)\n\n\n\n\nOver time, we’ve developed several shared workflows, but our code, documentation, and data management practices have not always been optimal. Luckily, this challenge is not unique to our lab and we decided to undertake Openscapes’ 10-week Supercharge plan during the 2020 Fall semester to learn more about current open science best practices. We dedicated a number of our regularly scheduled weekly lab meetings to the Openscapes modules with different combinations of students taking the lead each time.\nWhile we didn’t fully finish the 10-week plan, we made good progress in several areas. At the individual level, most of us started using GitHub to work collaboratively (no more emailing code back and forth!) and started intentionally organizing our files so that others, including our future selves, can more easily use them. We also found that collectively learning about the techniques was helpful when approaching concepts we weren’t familiar with, and as a result, our coding ability has increased tremendously!\nAs a lab, we wrote a formal code of conduct and created a lab-wide Github page. Most of our sessions were heavily discussion based, which was very helpful for getting everyone up to the same speed and learning about the topics, but we lacked time to actually implement all that we learned. As a result, while many of us made individual progress, most of the lab-wide goals like a shared GitHub page and a formalized onboarding and offboarding process still have work to be done.\nIn the current 2-month Champions Program, we are excited to learn more advanced techniques for what we’ve already implemented, discuss data management approaches with different CSU labs, and collaboratively implement more open science best practices. This will be an ongoing process, but we hope that by the end of the workshop we will be able to work more efficiently and collaboratively, and that we can further our lab goal of fostering a supportive and inclusive community approach to open science."

    "text": "In Fall 2022, Openscapes ran four concurrent Champions Cohorts that included participants from all NOAA Fisheries Science Centers, described in Nationwide Openscapes Training At NOAA Fisheries Science Centers: Facilitating Collaboration, Skill-Sharing, and Open Science. This post is the executive summary shared with Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) leadership of the work and experiences of AFSC research staff participants.\nUpdate February 21, 2023\nAFSC supported 8 teams from across the center in the 2022 Fall Openscapes Cohort of the Openscapes Champions training program. The teams focussed their energy on a range of important research issues supporting the AFSC mission including fishing tagging, fisheries surveys, marine mammals, genetics, shellfish, fish life history, and survey preparation. The teams consisted of 39 AFSC researchers from 7 AFSC divisions. Three of the 8 teams were cross-divisional. All teams developed their skills for improved analysis workflows, report writing, and manuscript preparation; promoting a culture of inclusivity and collaboration; improving on- and off-boarding processes; and integrated project management. This was achieved in the context of expanding open data science efforts within NOAA and the greater scientific community.\nFor each team, the training was just the beginning of a longer process. Over the four-week course of the workshop, the teams felt that Openscapes provided them with the support and time to tackle previously intangible tasks, track their progress, and install long-term collaboration and project management practices. While each team tackled very different challenges and goals with unique approaches, they often came to realize that their work needs had universal themes. Teams found new ways to fulfill needs for increased transparency, inclusivity, streamlining workflows, and professional development. The support and enthusiasm of AFSC leadership for AFSC to develop new skills and best practices is critical to AFSC’s continued organizational excellence. Participants in the training also recognized the need for additional training in specific skills and technologies (e.g., R, Python, Jupyter notebooks, Julia, Git and GitHub, Quarto, Posit Connect, reproducible analysis, and collaborative writing). The AFSC can support these needs by 1) identifying and funding training opportunities, and 2) encouraging scientists and supervisors to allocate work time to expanding knowledge and exploring new open data science skills.\nAs in the first AFSC Openscapes cohort, participants from this cohort found the training transformative. The training created a supportive forum for continued learning and collaboration across programs and divisions. As mentors, we are committed to maintaining the community of support and active learning that was established during the training. We feel confident that AFSC’s continued investment in Openscapes will establish AFSC scientists as leaders in open data science, enhance collaborations across divisions and centers, ensure continuity of long-term research efforts, and improve scientific communication with stakeholders."

    "text": "The Teams and Their Achievements\nThe 2022 Fall Openscapes cohort training took place over 5 remote calls from October 5 to November 30, 2022. Cohort calls focused on 1) establishing open science mindset and introducing psychological safety (call 1 digest), 2) publishing and project management on GitHub (call 2 digest), 3) instituting team culture and data strategies (call 3 digest), 4) nurturing open science communities and coding strategies (call 4 digest), and 5) developing each team’s path forward as they continue their open science journeys after Openscapes training (call 5 digest). Participants’ GitHub usernames are provided within each team description to connect them to their Openscapes work.\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of some of AFSC’s Openscapes participants over Zoom\n\n\n\nThe Marine Mammal Lab/RSST Lab Manual team focused their efforts on developing lab manuals for their teams. This team includes Katie Luxa (@katie-luxa), Erin Moreland (@eem1), Kim Shelden (@kewshel), Nancy Friday (@NAFriday), Cynthia Christman (@ChristmanCL), and Joanna Magner (@joannamagner-noaa; RSST). This cross-division collaboration gave the participants a wider-ranging perspective and an understanding of the universal problems different teams experience. Their lab manual covers on-/off-boarding, outreach, lab safety, field safety, travel, time and attendance, and employee resources. This lab manual was developed by referencing other lab manuals (e.g., Fay lab manual and with the team’s new skills in Quarto, GitHub repo and project management, and GitHub issue tracking. The lab manuals team saw this effort as an opportunity to unbury important lab and employee info from emails in one accessible page. Once complete, this MML lab manual will be moved to the AFSC Marine Mammal Lab GitHub Organization. The members of this team felt that their achievements and end products were more robust and inclusive because of how diversified their team was. The members of this team work across different programs and specialize in research on different species, and could share nuanced perspectives of what different documents and resources should include.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the AFSC Marine Mammal Lab Manual.\n\n\n\nThe AFSC Genetics team is motivated to develop a streamlined analysis pipeline. This team is represented by Patrick Barry (@PatrickBarry-NOAA), Diana Baetscher (@DianaBaetscher-NOAA), Sara Schaal (@SaraSchaal), and Claire Tobin (@ClaireTobin-NOAA). The team created a new GitHub organization that allows them to oversee product development, assign issues, and direct overall project management in teams that include postdocs and collaborators. GitHub provides tools for code versioning, documentation, and product testing that were critical for developing this pipeline. Together, they created different GitHub repositories for different projects and initiatives (e.g., sample collection, lab work, data storage) with links to resources and google docs. Members of the team came from a wide range of open science experience levels and worked together to teach and learn from each other through this process.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the AFSC Genetics GitHub Organization.\n\n\n\nThe PCod Tagging and MARVLS team set out on the dynamic task of streamlining multiple data sources to product workflow and diversified data management. This team is comprised of Susanne McDermott (@smcdermo), Julie Nielsen (@jknielsen), Kimberly Rand (@kimberlyrand), Liz Dawson (@liz-dawson-NOAA), Bianca Prohaska (@bianca-prohaska-NOAA), Christina Conrath (@ConrathCl), and Ajith Abraham (@Abraham-7600; OFIS) and ranged across several Pacific cod tagging sub-projects across RACE, the Maturity Assessment, Reproductive Variability, Life Strategy (MARVLS) group, and OFIS. Data from the tagged fish are opportunistically collected when a tag pops off a fish and reaches the sea surface and satellite connection and need to be regularly integrated into reports, websites, and on data sharing platforms. The team used mural boards to assist planning their database workflow and design. This visualization also helped motivate the team, outline what the next steps were, and create and assign tasks. When the team participants came together to work on this project, they were confronted with how similar their project themes and needs were.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of a section of the PCod Tagging Team’s database proposed design and workflow in Mural.\n\n\n\nThe MML Field Report team focused on new methods for working together and developing a ready-for-publication field report. This team includes Kim Goetz (@kimtgoetz), Megan Ferguson (@megancatonferguson), Molly McCormley (@mmccorml), Burlyn Birkmeier (@burlynb), and Amelia Brower (@ameliabrower-noaa). For this project, the team leaned on Eli Holmes’s book chapter code and quarto discussion forums, especially since Quarto is new and quickly evolving. This allowed the team to delegate chapter assignments and other report tasks (e.g., create a new section, edit yaml file, build report) through GitHub issues for team members to work on. The iterative and collaborative nature of the GitHub platform allowed the team to work through the idiosyncrasies of book and page formatting.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of a section of the MML field report team’s draft field report pdf made in Quarto.\n\n\n\nThe Oyster Monitoring and MML team comprises Peter Mahoney (@pmahoney-noaa), Skyla Walcott (@skylawalcott), Alex Zerbini (@alex-zerbini), Gavin Brady (@GavinMBrady), and Jordan Hollarsmith (@jhollarsmithnoaa). The team is formed of a composite of people from across the center who assisted their peers on their Oyster Monitoring project. For this effort, the team discussed how their universal work needs can be improved by universal lessons and learning GitHub project boards, Quarto, Mural boards (inspired by the PCod tagging team) and RMarkdown. In the Oyster Monitoring GitHub repository, the team worked together to develop the repository and documentation, and they worked with a SeaGrant Fellow to make an interactive quarto report website for the project!\nThe Groundfish Assessment Program Data Workflow team is working to codify the methods used to calculate survey design-based indices. This is a partnership of the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska/Aleutian Islands groups, including Duane Stevenson (@Duane-Stevenson-NOAA), Lukas DeFilippo (@Lukas-DeFilippo-NOAA), and Sarah Friedman (@SarahFriedman-NOAA), and Zack Oyafuso (@zoyafuso-NOAA). There are many bespoke scripts across the survey groups, for calculations of slightly different flavors of design-based indices, of which running each was often siloed to one person and underwent little to no code review. Expanding on the work already in the GAP Data Products GitHub organization, the team is developing an R package that will consolidate these analyses, interact directly with GAP Oracle databases, and include instructional documentation and vignettes. The package will undergo annual code review and validation, and promote greater collaboration and transparency with data users (e.g., stock assessors). The team relied on GitHub for version control, to post, task, and address issues. In addition, the team led an effort to include the other members of GAP, by initiating working groups to focus on data processes, computations, and future technologies. The team hopes this effort will bring the two survey groups closer together, make these analyses repeatable and transferable, and help develop a future vision for Future Us.\nThe MACE team was represented by Denise McKelvey (@mckelveyd), Katherine Wilson (@KatherineWilson-NOAA), and David McGowan (@McGowanDW). The program provided the space and guidance for this team to further increase their skills in, and awareness of, the platforms that MACE already uses for collaborative development, maintenance, and sharing of code and standardized reports. The tutorials offered by Eli Holmes (@eeholmes) and the examples of how others have adapted these lessons inspired the team members to envision new ways to collaborate as a team and leverage these tools. The course reinforced the team’s knowledge that Git can facilitate collaborations and increase efficiency by streamlining workflows, tracking issues, and supporting reproducibility. The team appreciated the coding tips that were shared and the cultural change movement that the course inspires: shifting away from work silos and moving towards collaborative and open approaches.\nThe REFM Spectroscopy Tools for Life History Measurements team comprised Esther Goldstein (@EstherDGoldstein-NOAA), Sandi Neidetcher (@SandiKay), Morgan Arrington (@MorganArrington-NOAA), Irina Benson (@ibens-git), and Beth Matta (@BethMatta-NOAA). This team is working to develop standardized scripts for processing and analyzing spectroscopy data that can be reviewed and shared easily among multiple individuals and centers. This effort is part of a NOAA-wide strategic initiative to develop spectroscopy as a tool for life history measurements (e.g., age, maturity, fish condition). The team realized the need to shift away from siloed scripts used by individuals for specific projects to a generalized open-source format. The team discussed how their work can be improved by using GitHub repositories to review and share scripts, GitHub projects to track issues to assign tasks, and RMarkdown/ Quarto for generating reports more efficiently. The team worked together to develop a GitHub organization, their first repository, practice reviewing scripts, and address issues as a team."

Josh London and others presented the cohorts’ successes with Openscapes at the Earth Science Information Partners Conference (ESIP) on January 26, 2023. There is interest across AFSC in further Openscapes training and this may be enabled by a 3-year grant proposal (co-PI’s Julie Lowndes and Eli Holmes) that would further advance this movement toward more open science in NOAA Fisheries. We’re excited to see how things develop in 2023 alongside the White House’s Year of Open Science initiative."

    "section": "",
    "text": ".rProfile Julia Stewart Lowndes\nThis interview was originally published by rOpenSci on February 9, 2018 as part of the .rprofile series.\n\n[This interview occurred at the 2017 rOpenSci unconference]\n\nSK: I’m Sean Kross, I’m the CTO of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab. Today I’m interviewing Julia Stewart Lowndes. Julia, what is your current preferred job title?\nJSL: I’m calling myself a marine data scientist - I’m the Science Program Lead for the Ocean Health Index.\nSK: How many years have you been working with R?\nJSL: I’ve been working for four years in R, so my experience has mostly been with the growing tidyverse.\nSK: How many hours a week do you spend in R?\nJSL: I probably spend 20 or 30 hours a week in RStudio, so not just coding in R but also using RMarkdown a lot.\nSK: What other technologies are part of your workflow?\nJSL: Right now my workflow is R, RStudio, git, GitHub for the most part.\nSK: You work with a team, and I imagine that there are different technical challenges with that. Do you collaborate with your team in GitHub?\nJSL: I work at NCEAS, which is the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at the University of California Santa Barbara. There are kind of concentric circles within our team but our core workflow is that everyone is working with RStudio and GitHub to some degree – even those who aren’t coding in R everyday.\nSK: Do you use public or private GitHub repositories?\nJSL: Most of our repositories are public. But we have one private repository just for Issues, and we use that as an email equivalent so that we can have discussions that are archivable.\nSK: What kind of R or science related media do you like to peruse?\nJSL: Twitter is my main source for finding R stuff. I listen to the RStudio webinars, which are amazing. I really enjoy watching and reading other people’s tutorials, and I listen to the NotSoStandardDeviations Podcast. One of my favorite episodes was with Jenny Bryan about Excel spreadsheets [Episode 9]. I’d never heard anyone talk about Excel spreadsheets like that; I had never heard such a philosophy for working with data in spreadsheets.\nSK: It’s very inspiring how she has this philosophy - and such an accepting and empathetic philosophy compared to what I think the common perception of Excel uses is among folks in the field of computing.\nJSL: I love it! And I love the times where they talk about how businesses use R or databases. I have no formal training in coding, so I don’t have the framework to even get engaged in a topic like databases, but they’re able to engage me just with their conversation and the topics they choose.\nSK: Do you have any go-to references?\nJSL: Well, R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund is my go-to for R. In grad school, Practical Computing for Biologists by Steve Haddock and Casey Dunn was my book. Both authors are marine biologists, and the point of the book was to get people who had no experience with computing exposed to and confident with the tools already on their computers that could help their science. There is a touch of command line, a touch of python, regular expressions in a text file, a bit of graphics – this book changed my science and my life. Steve and I were colleagues and I was lucky enough that I got to read and give feedback as he was finalizing the book. It totally changed not only my skill set, but my confidence in this computing world. I can’t recommend that book enough. So R for Data Science and Practical Computing for Biologists are my bedside table books.\nSK: Have you written any books?\nJSL: I’m writing a bookdown right now. It’s for the Ocean Health Index, we essentially enable government and academic groups to measure how healthy their oceans are. We give them a GitHub repository populated with starter files and scripts and they tailor it with their own data and priorities using our R package. So my book is about how to use our software, but it’s also how to use R, RStudio and GitHub. (Editor’s Note: since the interview this has been split into two books: Introduction to Open Data Science and Ocean Health Index Toolbox Training.)\nThe Nature paper I wrote was part of this realization that I’m putting a lot of effort into teaching people how to use our Ocean Health Index methods, but in that process I’m actually teaching them good data science practices. The stuff I’m teaching is not specific to the Ocean Health Index, so I wanted to try to hit a broader audience. (Editor’s Note: “Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools” (Lowndes et al. 2017; Nature Ecology & Evolution) was published the week before the rOpenSci #unconf17)\nSK: It’s so interesting that some people’s learning expectations are that maybe 80% of what I need to learn is specific to my field and 20% is computing/general/extra stuff that’s more widely applicable but doesn’t have to with the science. I feel like it might be the opposite - if you’re plugged into the the reproducible research techniques and all the good stuff coming out of the R community, that’s 80% of what you need to know - and you already have all the training and expertise in your field.\nJSL: I totally agree. I think one of the biggest light bulbs for me was realizing that data science is a thing, and that it is separate from my domain specific research. I wish I had discovered that when I was a grad student. That’s what I want to tell every grad student now – data science and domain science are distinct, and there are distinct places to get help. I learned to code in a total panic because my data was too big to be opened in Excel. So because I was trying to figure out science and coding at the same time, I conflated research with data science. I was confusing my thesis questions that no one had ever asked before with data questions that many people had asked before and solved – like renaming or transposing columns. Since I didn’t know these were distinct, I didn’t expect there to be solutions. I had this mindset that there was no one to ask and no help to get, which was demoralizing and I wasted a lot of time.\n\n\n“I was confusing my thesis questions that no one had ever asked before with data questions that many people had asked before and solved – like renaming or transposing columns… I had this mindset that there was no one to ask and no help to get, which was demoralizing and I wasted a lot of time.”\n\n\nKnowing that data science has concepts, theory, and tools is so powerful. When you’re learning to be a scientist, you have imposter syndrome all the time; there are so many things that you don’t know. I want to help scientists have the expectation that there’s a way to deal with the data challenges, so they can reach out beyond their own scientific community to look for help. If you think about data formatting - it doesn’t matter if you’re studying ocean science or archeology: data formatting is a data problem. And if you think about it as a data problem, you should expect that someone has encountered it before. It it doesn’t matter what field that someone is in; if they solved it, you can take the same solution to your data.\n\n\n“When you’re learning to be a scientist, you have imposter syndrome all the time; there are so many things that you don’t know. I want to help scientists have the expectation that there’s a way to deal with the data challenges.”\n\n\nSK: I think this is a big challenge going forward for the data science field, like it’s been for other fields, convincing an ocean scientist or a geologist that this “other field” is something they need. I think that other fields have had opportunities like this and just haven’t taken advantage of their potential.\nJSL: I think that the internet is changing the way that all this stuff can be incorporated into science. For most of the time I was in school, Google didn’t exist, so using the internet is not how I had been taught to learn. But now, Google is a go-to resource. I distinguish that my question is a data science question, I expect that someone has had my question before, I figure out how to articulate my question, I Google it, and I scan through the search results to see what could be a relevant answer, I learn what they did, and I incorporate the solution into my research.\n\n\n“I have conversations with grad students today that break my heart. They’re like, I know I need to learn R, and someday I will go to the library and check out a stats book. I’m like, I love libraries, but GOOGLE IT.”\n\n\nThe internet makes this all easier, but learning to code from online resources and communities is not yet the norm in science. I have conversations with grad students today that break my heart. They’re like, I know I need to learn R, and it’s this dread that is weighing on me, but someday I will go to the library and check out a stats book. I’m like, I love libraries, but GOOGLE IT. Read Hadley’s books online, join the welcoming #rstats community – I actually joined Twitter to learn R. The tidyverse and the community and development around it have changed the game in three huge ways in my mind: The tools are more powerful, they meet and engage people where they are, and there is a huge emphasis on teaching and training. All the amazing media - online books, tutorials, videos, slide decks, podcasts, groups like R-Ladies - all this stuff is there to help you learn more, no matter where you’re coming from. We need to help scientists expect that it’s there and that they are welcome too.\n\n\nPhoto by Elliot Lowndes"

SORTEE is a research community organization working to improve reliability and transparency through cultural and institutional changes in ecology, evolutionary biology, and related fields broadly defined. SORTEE is doing important work elevating open science within environmental science, and it was an honor to present about Openscapes at their inaugural conference. It was also a nice moment to reflect about Openscapes, as this year marks ten years of Ocean Health Index assessments, three years since Julie’s Mozilla Fellowship that launched Openscapes, two years after the useR!2019 keynote and one year after the ESIP plenary where we’ve been able to iteratively describe the vision and momentum of Openscapes. This post is some highlights about this 30-minute talk where we shared what we’ve been learning through Openscapes and working with Champions Cohorts together this past year and how we are approaching scaling and movement building going forward.\nQuick links:"

    "text": "Openscapes: Better Science for Future Us\n\n\n\n\nRemote plenary at the SORTEE inaugural conference, all artwork by @allison_horst\n\n\n\nOur plenary talk was called “Openscapes: Better Science for Future Us”. We started off by defining “better science” as science that is more open, reproducible, efficient, and more diverse, equitable, inclusive, and kind. Better science is for “Future Us”: the idea of our teams, and communities, and who will be joining and continuing our work, whether that is next hours, weeks or decades. Future Us is an important mindset for science and society at large, and particularly important in environmental science, because we are tackling huge issues like climate change and climate justice, and we can’t do this alone. Better science for future us is also a real investment, particularly for data-intensive research — this is true in terms of time, money, skillbuilding and safety, so that people are supported to do their best work.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe shared about how we built experiences from the Ocean Health Index, the R community, and Mozilla, into the design of Openscapes. This includes focusing first on teamwork and trust, then on co-creating common process, and upskilling with shared technology. Identifying the common parts of data analysis through Hadley Wickham’s conceptual diagram of data science and using common tools like RMarkdown helped us reimagine what we could do together for our science (Lowndes et al. 2017).\nOpenscapes is designed to empower other researcher teams do this too, no matter where they are starting from.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Champions Program we help teams focus on the common. This means helping normalize talking about data by creating place and space to do so; helping identify and address shared needs through exploring existing tooling, practices, and examples relevant to their own communities; and helping to think ahead for Future Us in terms of reproducibility, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and role-modeling kinder science and creating the culture we want to be a part of (Lowndes et al. 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\nSome really exciting work we’re doing is working with folks with NASA to help support NASA Earth science research teams’ migration to the cloud. Six teams at NASA are participating in our experimental Mentors Cohort to focus on common needs that researchers have when accessing NASA Earth data on the cloud. We are learning so much working with these awesome teams and identifying common place and space to address these shared needs. This work is part of our vision for scaling Openscapes: to help folks become Openscapes Mentors as part of their jobs so that they can use this approach to support their communities with what they need to learn. We’re co-creating the “NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook” using Quarto, which builds from what RStudio learned from RMarkdown and streamlines collaboration across R, Python, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing forward, we are interested in how can we support and incentivize open science together. How do we value modern contributions to science — both through products like open educational materials, websites, blogs, dashboards, art, software, and through people like trainers, mentors, research software engineers, community managers? How do we support the people who are already leaders in this space doing this work and encourage others as well? We are looking forward to continuing this work with SORTEE folks and beyond."

    "text": "AFSC Champions Cohort summary\nWe worked with Jeremy Rusin to bring the Openscapes Champions Program to AFSC, which included 8 teams. The teams consisted of 41 AFSC employees from 5 AFSC divisions and the Alaska Regional Office. All of the teams developed their skills for improved analysis workflows, report writing and manuscript preparation, promoting a culture of inclusivity and collaboration, intentional investment in on- and off-boarding processes, better collaboration with academic and state governments, and integrated project management. All of this was achieved within the context of a growing expansion of open science within NOAA and the greater scientific community. \nFor each of the teams, the Openscapes training was just the beginning of a longer process. It is essential that AFSC leadership, division directors, and supervisors continue to offer the support, time, space, and enthusiasm as teams continue to develop skills and implement meaningful new practices. Participants in the training also recognize the need for additional training in specific skills and technologies (e.g., R, Python, Git and GitHub, advanced Google Workspace, reproducible analysis, collaborative writing). The AFSC can provide support for these needs by both identifying and funding training opportunities, and by encouraging scientists to allocate work time for expanding knowledge and expertise through free resources and self-directed training.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of an Openscapes pathway written by the EcoFOCI team. The diagram summarizes how they used to share code, data, and files, and what their ongoing plans are for streamlining these processes and creating a team culture of openness and psychological safety.\n\n\n\nParticipants from the AFSC Openscapes cohort found the training transformative for their professional development. The training created a supportive forum for continued learning and collaboration across programs and divisions. As mentors for the AFSC Openscapes cohort, we are committed to the community of support and active learning environment established during the training. We feel confident in stating AFSC’s continued investment in Openscapes will establish AFSC scientists as leaders in open science, enhance collaborations across divisions and centers, ensure continuity of long-term research efforts, and improve scientific communication to all stakeholders. Everyone involved in the cohort looks forward to expanded Openscapes training opportunities in the near future.\nThe 2022 Openscapes cohort training took place over 5 remote calls from January 28 to March 11, 2022. Cohort calls covered: \n1) setting the open science mindset and discussing psychological safety, \n2) an introduction to publishing and project management on GitHub, \n3) instituting team culture and data strategies (Tidy Data), \n4) developing open communities and coding strategies (RMarkdown and Quarto), and \n5) preparing a team pathway document to guide their open data science journey after the training."

Cohort members were interested to hear from AFSC leadership about how the Board of Directors, program leads, and supervisors plan to support staff in learning these new skills and applying them in the future.\nEstablishing best practices across science centers for sharing large, confidential datasets with collaborators without having collaborators interact directly with internal databases. These challenges are not unique to AFSC and would benefit from cross-center collaboration.\nAllocating time for implementing open data science practices into performance plans by making the development of open science strategies and skills central to an employees’ priority activities and not an additional task relegated to ‘spare time’. \nIncluding contractors in trainings (like Openscapes) in the future, so that research teams can participate in full.\nContinued development of user-driven connections, communication, and collaborative learning between centers and between divisions at AFSC, including a focus on psychological safety. \nAdditional and specific technical training in RMarkdown, GitHub, RStudio Connect, public data sharing and team-building skills.\n\n\n\n\n\nA zoom view of the 2022 AFSC Openscapes Cohort!"

    "text": "Meet the teams and some of their work!\nThe EcoFOCI Ecosystem Indicators Team aims to streamline, document, and standardize survey data analysis and annual reporting of EcoFOCI ecosystem indicators for ESRs and ESPs. This team includes Lauren Rogers (@larogers123), Jesse Lamb (@jesseflamb), Kelia Axler (@keliaaxler), Ali Deary (@AlisonDeary-NOAA), and David Kimmel (@kimmeld09). Before Openscapes, the team felt that tight timelines forced the team to work “quickly; not always carefully” and that the Openscapes training gave them space to explore easier, faster, and more consistent ways to prepare results. The team created a GitHub organization to help them codify data and code, and more importantly, invest in culture change. The team heavily discussed establishing a culture of modeling openness, sharing early code, and asking for expertise. The team aptly phrased the latter as “hidden expertise,” as the expertise may exist, but on local computers and unbeknownst to their peers, forcing others to reinvent workflows and processes that were already established. \nThe Marine Mammal Stock Assessments Team aims to streamline the development, review, and publication of the annual Alaska marine mammal stock assessment reports. This team includes Nancy Young (@nancycyoung), Brian Fadely (@BFadely), Rod Towell (@rtowell), Tony Orr (@Tony-Orr), and Erin Richmond (@erinrichmond). Through Openscapes, the team used GitHub, a new GitHub organization, wikis, and R Markdown to establish processes for preparing data and analyses, tackle outdated version control workflows, and improve on and offboarding procedures. The team focused on developing one SAR in R Markdown as a proof of concept. The team found that seaside chats spurred open discussion and idea sharing and plan to keep meeting after Openscapes. \nThe Groundfish Food Habits Team is focused on streamlining reproducible flow of code and data to provide food habits and model data to ESRs, ESPs, and stock assessments. This team includes Kerim Aydin (@kaydin-NOAA), Kirstin Holsman, Bridget Ferriss (@BridgetFerriss), Geoff Lang (@geofflang-NOAA), and Jonathan Reum. The team found that writing out the pathways document helped confirm next overarching steps for the group, that there were changes that needed to happen in their workflow, and that they needed to establish best practices. In an effort to foster a culture of reuse, the team started and tested out a GitHub organization and other avenues for collaboration so they can find the best platform forward for their unique team’s needs. \nThe Shellfish Assessment Program Team is focused on 1) improving annual Tech Memo and 2) improving collaboration on bitter crab disease reports. This team included Mike Litzow (@mikelitzow), Jonathan Richar (@JonRichar-NOAA), Erin Fedewa (@Erin-Fedewa-NOAA), Leah Zacher (@LeahZacher-NOAA), and Jen Gardner (@JenniferGardner-NOAA). Through the Openscapes program, the team devised a plan for accessing raw data, to data wrangling, to preparing tech memo figures. With their new GitHub organization, they had the tools to start earnest discussions on how to document their work. \nThe AFSC Stock Assessment Team’s overarching goal is to 1) create reproducible stock assessments and streamline reporting and presenting to Council bodies (specific project could be to take two assessments as examples: arrowtooth flounder and northern rockfish), 2) improve data to modeling to reporting for economic models, 3) create consistent fishery data sources across science and management, and 4) discuss of CFI implementation. This team includes Kalei Shotwell (@kshotwell), Meaghan Bryan (@mdbryan), Jim Ianelli (@jimianelli-NOAA), Ben Williams (@BenWilliams-NOAA), Chris Lunsford (@chrislunsford-NOAA), Alan Haynie (@alanhaynie-NOAA), and Anne Hollowed. Openscapes motivated the group to develop the Stock Modeling and Assessment Reproducibility Team (SMART), a supporting SOP, and a GitHub organization. SMART combines the two stock assessment teams and coordinates regular meetings and overarching goals for the effort. Through SMART, the team presented at the Informal Stock Assessment Advances in Methods meeting (March 1 and 3) on their openscapes work and conducted a survey in part to figure out where they could better support their peer stock assessors. \nTrophic Roles of Ice Seals RWP Team aims to develop a new Regional Work Plan-funded project to estimate the consumption of dominant prey by ice-associated seals in the Bering and Chukchi seas that would involve collaborators within and beyond NOAA. This team includes Stacie Hardy (@staciekozhardy), Peter Boveng (@PeterBoveng-NOAA), Heather Ziel (@zielhl), Michael Cameron (@MichaelCameron-NOAA), and Johanna Vollenweider (@JohannaPage-NOAA). The team felt that Openscapes created a space for members to collect thoughts, define a more efficient and thoughtful workflow ecosystem (e.g., tidyverse) to work within, and start planning how they can share what they learned and hope to implement with their larger group. The team worked on how their new GitHub Organization could help them work with external collaborators and instill version control as projects evolve. The team felt that working though this example project provided them with a universal framework that can be transferred to other existing projects. \nThe Fisheries Monitoring Team is focused on improving the Annual Deployment Plan analytic and report production workflow and result sharing with council, stock assessors and the public. This team includes Craig Faunce (@CraigFaunce-NOAA), Phil Ganz (@philganz), Jennifer Cahalan (@JenCahalan-NOAA), and Geoff Mayhew (@geoffmmayhew). Galvanized by Openscapes’ GitHub tutorial and an endeavor to streamline the onboarding and offboarding process, the team has begun moving much of their dataset wrangling scripts and issue tracking to GitHub. The team has also begun developing standard datasets for everyone to use in easy to access locations. \nThe Midwater Pollock Assessment Team aims to create a reproducible and transparent abundance analysis and reporting process for the management of midwater walleye pollock data in Alaska. This team includes Mike Levine (@mike-levine), Sarah Stienessen (@sstienessen), Nate Lauffenburger (@nlauffenburger), Sam Urmy (@ElOceanografo), and Abigail McCarthy (@abigailatsea). This team used their time with Openscapes to explore the best project management platform for their team and survey preparation, realizing that trello and smartsheets gave the team the flexibility they needed. The team also began automating cruise reports with R Markdown. The team next plans on providing a demonstration and presentation to the rest of their larger group as they start planning for their summer survey."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Cross-posted at emLab\nThis is a guest post from Darcy Bradley, marine ecologist and Research Director of the Environmental Market Solution Lab’s Ocean Program at UC Santa Barbara. A leader in many realms, Darcy is thrilled to be a part of a community that celebrates open and reproducible data science; this post provides a glimpse into how she engaged that community to help her and her team improve project and data management for her research group.\n\nOne year ago, I wrote a blog post about the exciting role big data promises to play in revolutionizing natural resource management. Indeed, our research program has rapidly evolved to take advantage of the huge amounts of information made available by new technologies and clever data platforms. While this exciting transition has enabled us to ask questions that weren’t even imaginable just a few short years ago, our increasing reliance on externally sourced data, expanded collaborative networks, and high powered computing infrastructure to handle increasingly complex analyses has not been without growing pains. The imperative for a thoughtful and standardized data infrastructure was something we could no longer ignore.\nSo this is a story of our journey from opaque project structures to standardized, transparent, and version controlled workflows. It’s a story of learning from others, leveraging our team’s extensive data science and project management expertise, and working to build a streamlined and thoughtful data infrastructure. Ultimately, it’s a story that can best be told through the lessons we’ve learned along the way.\nLesson 1. Don’t reinvent the wheel. Fortunately for us, Santa Barbara is no stranger to open data science and innovative project management. Our friends and neighbors at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) – and their Ocean Health Index team in particular – are global leaders in open environmental data science. Senior Fellow and Data Scientist Dr. Julia Stewart Lowndes has been at the forefront of NCEAS’s pioneering open science efforts, recently founding Openscapes to train others in open science practices to enable “better science in less time.” Julie became our data streamlining guru – she quickly identified that we ought to consider crafting a data management standard operating procedure (offering her team’s SOP as an example) and provided resources and guidance to set us on our way.\nLesson 2. Collaborative science is the best science. To effectively create a new vision for our internal data infrastructure, we knew we needed to draw on the wide range of expertise from our team. A self-assembled group of data managers, project researchers, and project managers began to meet regularly to map out an aspirational data and project management infrastructure. We reflected upon the collaborative software platforms, open data science, and project management tools that worked best for our team. We recorded best practices for file structure, naming, data storage, and metadata and thought through script standardization and version control. We assembled how-to guides for leveraging high performance computing resources of ever growing importance for our memory intensive analyses. Importantly, we connected the dots between our workstreams to actualize our vision of a fully integrated data management system, which we collaboratively documented in the emLab Standard Operating Procedure. And then we turned it loose, inviting the entire emLab community to participate in a one day Data Hackathon to document and migrate our data inputs, outputs, and repositories to our now centralized and streamlined data system.\n\n\n\n\nemLabers hard at work during our one day data Hackathon\n\n\n\nLesson 3. Iterate and evolve. Our SOP is a living document that will continue to evolve as we do. There is an ebb and flow to the chatter on our “data-streamlining” Slack channel but we are collectively committed to continually improving our data practices and our SOP as needs arise. We’ve learned that a commitment to better data management takes time and effort, but the payoff is immediate. Our SOP is the centerpiece of our onboarding process, and our improved data infrastructure has already been leveraged to synthesize vast and disparate elements of global fisheries data into a user-friendly, interactive online tool. As a team committed to conducting research for real-world impact, our approach is inherently outward looking, forward thinking, and often based on externally generated sources of information. Our journey to re-envision our data infrastructure required us to reflect instead on our internal processes, to tear them apart and collectively rebuild something better, something more thoughtful and transparent, a new system that affirms our commitment to open and reproducible data science."

While this post seems a bit personal for the Openscapes blog, I wanted to share a bit about how our open science process made it possible, because one of the things we hear often from researchers is that they feel like they can’t take vacation - too much rests solely on their shoulders, solely on their laptops. And I have felt this way too, which was one reason why time off was a long time coming. Taking time off in some ways was an experiment, a stress-test of our workflow, and it had very positive results with everything working more-than-smoothly in my absence, room for leadership and grow of others, and me returning feeling fresh. This post shares a bit about our teamwork and shared workflows setup, as well as some highlights from visiting family in the UK and Italy."

    "text": "Open science teamwork and shared systems\nOpenscapes has two big main projects right now, with NASA Earthdata and NOAA Fisheries. With NASA-Openscapes, Erin Robinson and I are supporting the NASA Mentors from seven Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they develop and teach tutorials to help researchers using NASA Earthdata migrate their workflows to the cloud. This fall, they are focused on writing a white paper, updating the Cookbook and Cheatsheets, enhancing the earthdatapython library (soon to be renamed earthaccess), creating workshop templates, while also leading workshops and other contributions with their DAACs. With NMFS-Openscapes, Eli Holmes, Stefanie Butland, Ileana Fenwick, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Mentors and I are leading four Champions Cohorts that include researchers and supervisors from all six Fisheries Science Centers and several Regional Offices and the Office of Science and Technology as they learn and develop shared open science habits with their colleagues. We’ve got a lot going on - and it is all really engaging and exciting work with and in support of truly awesome people.\nIn both projects, we’ve developed shared systems that we’ve invested in over time with practices that help us collaborate remotely whether we are synchronous or asynchronous. These practices build resilience into our teams day-to-day so that we can collaborate and also step in to help each other (for example, to help adjust timing on the fly or co-teach when internet temporarily cuts out). This includes using shared Google Calendars and Google notes docs, Slack Channels, GitHub repositories, Issues, and Project Boards, and Quarto websites. These tools and places where information “lives” supports our shared habits, so we know where to look for things. They also help us work efficiently synchronously during our regular Cohort Calls, Seaside Chats, and Coworking times, as well as asynchronously as get notifications with handoffs or requests for review or help.\nSpecifically leading up to my absence, we thought further ahead on the calendar and made TODO lists, made sure permissions and Zoom links were updated, invited guest teachers, practiced during several pre-scheduled dry runs. (Yes, there were some Zoom links I’d missed updating but folks were able to Slack updated links and help each other, which we’ve also had to do before!). Folks knew I would be reachable if needed but otherwise that I would check my emails/slacks for 1 hour at a set time each Tuesdays during California work time to respond to anything pressing.\nHow did it go? So great. It felt like a gift, and I’m so so grateful to Erin, Stef, Ileana, Eli and the NASA and NMFS Mentors who graciously carried everything forward with NASA and supported the NMFS Champions while I was gone. I was happy to create space for others to lead, experiment, do things their way so I can continue learning from them as I’m back. I felt like I could actually truly relax knowing how everyone would be able to carry on without me. It was a quite liberating experience to “not be needed”. It was wonderful. And I’m invigorated to be back - I missed everyone, as well as the work!\n\nHoliday highlights\nFor folks interested, of course the trip itself was lovely: we visited my husband’s parents and siblings in the UK and Italy. This was the first time seeing my husband’s family and traveling abroad in three years, so the trip was extra meaningful after so long (as well as 4 vaccines, masks, and testing). It was so wonderful to spend time with them, doing my favorite things: hanging out, hiking, and eating delicious things.\nFirst, we spent two weeks in the UK’s Lake District National Park. My mother-in-law had planned hikes, meals, and a few small cultural events (we visited Beatrix Potter’s cottage)!. Highlights included:\n\nSteamtrain to Eskdale, a hike around Brae Tarn and a pub lunch outside, with a pint indoors when the rains came\nBoat across Ullswater and a hike back along the lake, with fall colors and afternoon tea with four tiers of cakes and scones\nLearning that Beatrix Potter was an ahead-of-her time conservationist and feminist, using her self-made wealth to preserve the Lake District from industrialization and helped found the National Trust!\nFish and chips on Morecombe Bay at sunset!\n\nThen, we spent one week in northern Italy. It was a holiday weekend so we had half the time staying in a little town in the Dolomites and half the time at home in Treviso where the kids have school. Highlights included:\n\nHiking on clear days with panoramic views, eating cheese-cucumber sandwiches, boiled eggs, and grapes off the vine\nHide-and-seek with siblings in the Airbnb - a vertical house with 4 stories of two rooms per floor with plenty of cool furniture and alcoves to hide in\nCycling in rural Treviso to take siblings to school, visit the market, and then eat homemade lasagne, minestrone soup (Veneto-style), and having mascarpone with sweet jam and biscuits, teaching the kids to knit\nHearing Italian and German spoken, seeing alpine architecture with window flowerbeds and woodpiles, and eating so much (but never enough) pizza\n\nHere are some photos, taken by Elliot Lowndes (mrlowndes.com). Thanks for reading!"

    "text": "This is a guest blog by Marcus Beck that describes how the Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) is embracing open science principles and tools to create better science in less time. Marcus, along with TBEP Executive Director Ed Sherwood, both attended the NCEAS Open Science for Synthesis workshop in July 2017 at Santa Barbara. Marcus, Ed, and the rest of the TBEP team are working to bring open science to improve the management of Tampa Bay and extend their applications to the broader network of the 28 National Estuary Programs. This blog describes one application of automating a routine reporting document that builds on the data and tools developed throughout the 30 year history of TBEP.\nUpdate July 13 2021: Check out TBEP’s Data Management SOP( Standard Operating Procedures)!\nThose of us working in coastal environments are likely familiar with the success story of Tampa Bay. Like many surface waters in the US prior to the Clean Water Act, Tampa Bay was impacted by nutrient pollution from untreated wastewater and surface runoff. Through a coordinated regional effort of environmental professionals, utility operators, and local politicians, nutrient loads to the Bay have been reduced by ~2/3 from 1970s levels and seagrasses have recovered to a 1950s benchmark extent.\nThe Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) has been a key facilitator among the many local partners that have an interest in the region’s natural resources. TBEP is one of 28 estuaries in the EPA’s National Estuary Program that focuses on “estuaries of national significance” to provide place-based solutions to managing these complex systems. This includes establishing benchmarks for restoration goals and tracking the status and trends of key indicators of environmental health.\nTBEP uses a water quality report card that summarizes annual progress in achieving core programmatic goals for the Tampa Bay estuary. This product communicates to partners what needs to be done to ensure water quality targets are met to support seagrass growth. However, a new report is needed each year that requires considerable effort to manually compile the data, synthesize the results, and produce the final document.\nThis blog describes an open science approach developed by TBEP to automate creation of the annual water quality report. The methods leverage many open source tools that are freely available and easily modified for customizable report generation. A broad overview of the approach is provided to encourage others to consider how these open science workflows can lead to better, kinder science in less time."

    "text": "Final thoughts\nThis workflow was developed as a proof of concept to see if it was reasonable for automating our routine reporting products. We’re in the process of testing and refining this workflow on other products (references library, field data plotting). Although there is substantial overhead in creating the process, we now have a quicker and reproducible approach to delivering decision-support tools that affect the health of Tampa Bay. We are all time-limited, and this workflow reduces the tedium of manually creating these reports each time they are needed.\nThis workflow is also dependent on the strong technical foundation for evaluating water quality in Tampa Bay and the invaluable work by our partners in collecting/curating the underlying data. This work would not have been possible without the past research, partner initiatives, and community of collaboration that have been the foundation of TBEP and the region’s success in improving the estuary. Having a direct online connection to the raw data is also a necessary component - and on this front, there’s much more work to be done to ensure this information and all of our partner data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).\nFinally, these tools and concepts are generalizable to other locations with similar needs. Open science methods emphasize reproducibility and technology transfer as important benefits that come with investments in developing these tools. The 28 estuary program collective in the US are beginning to embrace these tools so that they can efficiently report on routine estuarine indicators on a broad national scale. This will facilitate shared learning and experiences by using a common and standardized set of reporting products created with open science principles at the core.\n\n\nLearn more:\n\nR introduction to using Travis: link\nSetting up Travis CRON jobs: link\nGetting Travis to talk to GitHub: link\ntbeptools R package: link\nTBEP GitHub group web page: link\nTBEP data visualization page: link\n#TampaBayOpenSci"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Summary: start small, be hands-on, use existing tutorials, have fun.\nHere is my advice for starting a coding club.\nAn example is Eco-Data-Science at UCSB. We are currently a community of >100 people; we meet 2x/month at the UCSB Library’s Collaboratory and skill share peer-to-peer, with all resources organized and archived on the website. But we started off small, with co-founder Jamie giving tutorials to friends one-on-one.\n\n\nStart off with a few interested people so that you can start now with less scheduling involved. Find a space to meet in your lab, or department.\n\n\n\nPlan for most sessions to be hand-on: have everyone bring their laptops and have a screen available that everyone can watch as they follow along and take notes on their own computer.\n\n\n\nThe internet is full of great tutorials made by really kind and smart people. Use them. They might not be within your scientific context, and that is OK, maybe better, even. In your first sessions, watch a video together of someone teaching a topic of interest. Then have someone teach live from an existing written tutorial. When you get to a point where there is a topic you want to learn or teach and you can’t find a tutorial that suits your purpose, make your own!\nWhere to start? Here are some R/RStudio and GitHub recommendations that helped us learn. They are tutorials and also academic papers for journal clubs. (Note: some are more hands-on than others).\nFor a little more direction within that list:\n\nwatch RStudio webinars. Look at the Learning Roadmap:\n\n“RStudio Essentials”\n“Data Science Essentials”\n“Advanced Data Science: Collaboration and time travel — version control with git, github, and RStudio”\n\n\npractice RStudio with GitHub: create free websites with RMarkdown\n\nAlso, Google “[topic] [language] tutorial” and see what you find.\n\n\n\nCoding is powerful and empowering, it is also social. Have fun, and be respectful and inclusive.\n\n\n\nTalk about your group with others, and your numbers will grow. Ask others to present, particularly if you know someone knows something that you’d like to learn. Build allies and ask for support, from your department, from your library.\nEco-Data-Science has a nice website, right? That came after we had been meeting as a small group informally for awhile, but we were growing and wanted to be more organized and inclusive. So when the time came, we joined as a Mozilla Study Group and used their website template so that we didn’t get slowed down by operational stuff and could continue to focus on skill-sharing with each other. This also put us on the Mozilla’s map of study groups so that people can find us more easily. Now, when I travel to other universities, I see if they have a study group in the network.\nLearn more about Mozilla Study Groups:\n\nMozilla’s study group orientation\nStevens et al 2018: Building a local community of practice in scientific programming for Life Scientists\n\n\n\n\nThe advice above assumes that you’ve looked to see if there are already coding clubs that exist that you could join. In addition to seeing if there is a Mozilla Study Group near you, see if there is an R Users Group Meetup, RLadies, or other non-R focused groups near you!\n\n\n\nIf you are in a leadership position and students want to start a coding club, here is what you can do to help enable it:\n\nhelp get rooms\nsubsize snack & beers\nconnect potentially interested people\nhelp it be visible: talk about it on campus and beyond\n\n\n\nPhoto by Elliot Lowndes"

    "text": "Background\nWe were thrilled to co-teach the R for Excel Users workshop at rstudio::conf(2020)! From early on in our weekly early-morning work sessions and brainstorming hikes, we knew that our R for Excel Users workshop would not be about wholesale translating Excel operations into R. Instead, it would be a more holistic approach to reproducible analyses with R – a friendly introduction to becoming a modern R user.\n\n\n\n\nArt by Allison Horst\n\n\n\nOur philosophy was always about empowering our attendees to continue learning R after our workshop – and so that they would be excited about it. We wanted to teach not only the skillsets of the modern R user, but also the habits and mindsets for working in a reproducible and collaborative way. Through hands-on experience our attendees would build skills and confidence at the workshop, and through stories and packages from the #rstats community, they would build the mindset to expect what they want to do is possible and have a good start to finding it.\nThus, attendees would learn:\n\ncoding with best practices (RStudio/tidyverse)\ncollaborative bookkeeping (Git/GitHub)\nreporting and publishing (RMarkdown/GitHub)\n\nAnd they would build the mindset:\n\nto expect that what they want to do is possible\nto have confidence they can find it\nto continue learning with supportive community\nto enable others\n\nFocusing on #rstats communities at our workshop was especially important to us because of our audience. These folks were coming to a 2400-person conference all about R – and they did not yet know R! That seems scary! Anything we could do to not only teach them about reproducible workflows but also make the conference easier to navigate for a newcomer we felt was time well spent. Thus, we deliberately focused time on R learning communities that they would see and can get involved in at the conference and afterwards. And, we included a discussion about how Twitter is a legit tool for R, and how to get started."

    "text": "Teaching at RStudio::conf!\nWe taught R for Excel Users at RStudio::conf(2020) with our amazing TAs (and fellow Santa Barbara R-Ladies) Jessica Couture and Jamie Montgomery! We jumped into Day 1 of the workshop with 25 optimistic participants from industry, government offices, non-profits, and even several RStudio employees.\n\n\n\n\nJulie, Jessica, Allison, and Jamie at RStudio::conf(2020)!\n\n\n\nOur workshop assumed no previous experience with R or RStudio. After setting the tone and expectations of the workshop with how R is like the Force from Star Wars, we spent the first two sessions on meeting, exploring, and setting up our tools, including:\n\nMeeting the RStudio IDE, Hello R Markdown!, Packages, Functions\nWorking between GitHub and R projects\n\nWith Jessica and Jamie’s awesome troubleshooting, we were all off and running at the end of Session 2 with RStudio, R Markdown, and GitHub and installed, running, and somewhat familiar. Of course after getting set up with our software, we had work to do! We spent the rest of the day:\n\nMaking ggplot graphs\npivot tables in R with group_by() %>% summarize()\n\nOur fearless attendees returned on Day 2, with a chorus of “Alligator mouth dash” (<-) in response to Alison’s question “How do we assign an object in R?”. We immediately jumped into coding by:\n\nReshaping, separating and uniting things with tidyr\nFiltering and joining data\nGetting help, #rstats communities, and collaborating/fixing merge conflicts in GitHub\nSynthesis of the skills and tools we’d learned\n\nOur final session was revisiting and practicing all that we had learned throughout the workshop while participants also collaborated on RMarkdown files with each other through GitHub.\nThe vibe throughout the workshop was fun and lighthearted, which is exactly what we were hoping for. In addition to “Alligator mouth dash”, my favorite moment in the whole workshop was an audible whisper (“very nice!”) from someone using separate() for the first time. A close second was the cheers for janitor::clean_names() and Allison’s responding, “Yes, this is worth cheering over!”. Our attendees were hard-working folks with a great attitude and sense of humor, who are now equipped for more exciting steps in their R journey."

    "text": "What’s next\nWe loved developing and teaching R for Excel Users, and hope to do it again. Our course materials evolved quite a bit throughout months of development, and were hugely helped by a pilot workshop we ran at UC Santa Barbara in early December. Even so, there are little things we would like to iron out and improve upon for next time. And we will also update the Book with images from the Slides so that the Book is completely self-contained and the Slides are a bonus, rather than a necessity.\nWe also got feedback that we should change the name of the course because while it has some framing from Excel, it is certainly not limited to Excel Users. This seems like a good idea. When we were first talking to RStudio’s Alison Hill about the workshop, we discussed how it could be somewhat of a precursor to Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester’s What They Forgot to Teach You About R – ours being What You Should Know When You Learn R. Jenny and Jim’s have a great acronym, WTF, so I have been thinking about names. I learned from Jenny that WTF was a welcome byproduct that came after they came up with the workshop name, but I have to approach it as a backronym. I’ve had many terrible ideas, but! Through cocktail chats at the conference with Charlotte Wickham and Hannah Frick, we landed on TLDR being best. I love Charlotte’s suggestion of Take a Leap and Dive into R or my less-great Time to Learn Data analysis in R. This is an ongoing pursuit, and suggestions are very welcomed :).\n \n\nphoto by Brunel Johnson with art by Allison Horst"

    "text": "This is a brief post summarizing my co-keynote at rstudio::conf(2022), with Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel titled Hello Quarto: share, collaborate, teach, reimagine.\nAll slides, demos, art, are available for reuse and remix!\n\nrecording - rstudio.com/conference/2022/keynotes/collaborate-with-quarto\nslides - mine.quarto.pub/hello-quarto\nrepo - github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/hello-quarto\nart - https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1552693891706413056\ntwitter thread - https://twitter.com/juliesquid/status/1553527320308338688\n\n\nAt rstudio::conf(2022), I had the distinct honor to welcome folks to Quarto, which Openscapes has been using to collaborate and reimagine how we tackle inclusive environmental science & the climate crisis. Openscapes was the first external user of Quarto, collaborating with the Quarto developer team and NASA Earthdata Openscapes Mentors for the last year to develop and teach tutorials to help researchers migrate their workflows to the cloud. We’ve primarily used Quarto as Python users, creating beautiful collections of Jupyter notebooks that are Quarto websites, including the 2021 Cloud Hackathon and the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook. Learn more through A Quarto Chat with NASA Openscapes, co-hosted with R-Ladies Santa Barbara with Catalina Oaida, Aaron Friesz, Amy Steiker, and J.J. Allaire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork from “Hello, Quarto” keynote by Julia Lowndes and Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, presented at RStudio Conference 2022. Illustration by Allison Horst.\n\nWhat is Quarto? Quarto is software that unifies & extends the RMarkdown ecosystem. Quarto builds from 10 years of lessons and development from RMarkdown - which has been transformative for the R community - streamlining reproducibility across coding languages (R, Python, Julia) and comfort levels (new and seasoned coders of all career levels). It is a new open source system supporting publishing scientific and technical writing, and one place that this shows up is as an absolute game-changer for citations, which will dramatically help scientists and research teams focus on their science. An audible “wow” came from the audience when I demoed how to insert citations in-line by typing @, which lets you select from your existing Zotero references or paste in a DOI.\nThis was a co-keynote with Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, where we introduced Quarto through stories and demos in 4 parts: share, collaborate, teach, reimagine. We collaborated for months on this talk, pushing our/my knowledge of Quarto, designing the talk structure, practicing, working with @allison_horst on beautiful art that is available for reuse. I talked about how Quarto helped our NASA Openscapes team collaborate across coding languages, giving us a place for Python and R users to create beautiful teaching materials together. And I pushed folks to reimagine open source and open science as part of the climate movement. Quoting All We Can Save, “we need every solution and every solver”, I shared an example of a Quarto site for culture change created by the Fay lab, which studies marine fisheries, food systems, and climate change. They are radically reimagining inclusion and open data science through making the implicit explicit, onboarding learners as contributors, and prioritizing psychological safety and a growth mindset. Learn about the process of migrating this guide to Quarto from Bookdown (blog).\n\n\n\n\nTweet from Catherine Kim, PhD at rstudio::conf\n\n\n\nThis keynote was an enormous honor, having grown up professionally in the R (#rstats) community and first welcomed by groups like rOpenSci, R-Ladies, RStudio, the Carpentries, and Mozilla - I’ve written about this quite a bit in the past: RStudio Conference culture, RStudio Conference 2020, rOpenSci’s leadership in #rstats culture. And I continue to grow so much through support and collaborations from so many, first and foremost Erin Robinson, who brought Openscapes and NASA together and developed our flywheel.\nThis keynote was a big deal, and I *struggled* to clearly scope the reimagine part. So grateful to so many people who listened, coached, inspired me, including @minebocek, @allison_horst, @connector_erin, @StefanieButland, @LizNeeley, @_ileanaf, @eeholm, @CieraReports, @hfcfrick, @adyadyan, @gavin_fay, @tararobertson, @deepseadawn, @katharine_mach, @apreshill. I could go on for much longer, but to close -\nI am so grateful to J.J. Allaire for his mentorship and friendship and the opportunity to collaborate with Quarto. And I also appreciate J.J., Hadley Wickham, Joe Cheng, Jenny Bryan, and Hannah Frick for their support throughout the years and as well as helping me build confidence in the days before the keynote. And of course Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel on co-creating the keynote and reading Ileana Fenwick’s quote, as I reimagined what I could do :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork from “Hello, Quarto” keynote by Julia Lowndes and Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, presented at RStudio Conference 2022.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome to Openscapes’ seventh newsletter! If you’re interested in seeing these infrequent updates in your inbox, please sign up here (linked from our get involved page). And! If you have signed up but did not see this in your inbox, please check your spam folder!\nHello! We are so excited to announce a new program starting next week: Openscapes Reflections! Details follow below - we’re responding to a need we’ve heard and are experimenting with a format we’ve forked from professional leadership coaching. We hope you’ll consider signing up or passing along this opportunity to your colleagues. Julie Lowndes and Ileana Fenwick are designing and leading the Reflections Program this year, with support from Stefanie Butland.\nOpenscapes Reflections is an open data science coaching program for researchers and those who support research. Reflections is a 3-week program (1 hour/week) modeled from professional leadership coaching, skills increasingly core to the Openscapes approach. From May 9-26 2023, Reflections is a light-weight way to reflect on your workflows and make goals going into summer.\nWe designed Reflections to be rewarding for people who haven’t been part of Openscapes initiatives so far, as well as returning folks who want some accountability and space to reflect on their workflows and plan how open data science practices can fuel institutional culture change. We wanted to create a space for us all to get a little less stuck in our daily workflows (folders full of files with names like “Report_with_figuresFINAL_v2.doc” anyone?) so we can redirect our energy to the part of our work that we care about, connected to our values for climate change and social justice. If this sounds enticing to you, we hope you’ll join us.\nBackground. Over the last five years Openscapes has helped hundreds of researchers improve their work and life through open and kinder science. We know many like you have been looking for a lighter-weight way to get involved or continue building habits to support yourself and your colleagues. We’ve designed the Reflections Program to meet this need and also be more accessible and affordable. We’ve specifically designed it for people who:\nWe know that making space to talk about workflows is so important for teams – Seaside Chats and Coworking are often cited as the most valuable parts of Openscapes when we check in with teams we’ve worked with in academia and government. These spaces are where folks identify their needs and begin addressing them through individual skillbuilding and shared workflow redesign, whether or not they work with data or code. Making this space to reflect is an integral part of Openscapes Champions and we think it will be helpful to folks as a stand-alone program that can include far more people.\nOverview & registration. Reflections will run from May 9-26 2023 (1 hour/week). Through weekly prompts and community huddles, you’ll have opportunities to reflect on your own time or together in a way we hope leaves you feeling intentional and empowered. Each week will have a specific focus and structure. This program has a $95 value. We intend to make this program accessible to anyone interested, with Openscapes sponsorship available. Learn more and register on the Reflections webpage."

    "title": "RStudio Conference culture",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I attended RStudio::conf this year and there is so much to report from a conference that gathers 1700 attendees from industry and academia and disciplines of all kinds. The conference centered around innovations, motivations, and communities around the R programming language and there are many excellent summary blogs. Here I will focus on how the conference felt, and how to think about replicating this feeling at conferences, workshops, meetings, and lab groups.\n\n  \n\n\nRStudio::conf 2019 was the best conference I’ve ever been to. I learned about new R packages, motivations behind them and lessons from using them as individuals and teams. But I think the real reason it was the best conference was the positive tone and culture that helped me connect with many thoughtful people. And this positive tone was set deliberately from the beginning.\n\n\nHadley Wickham’s opening remarks included the Code of Conduct and how to identify the numerous RStudio staff that are there to help if any problems occur. Codes of Conduct are meant to deliberately help people be included and empowered within communities, recognizing that safety and accessibility are critical parts of inclusion and empowerment. Hadley is Chief Scientist at RStudio, and by stating the Code of Conduct up front he put the RStudio community’s values clearly forward, and it had additional weight because it came from the RStudio leadership.\nJust afterwards, Hadley introduced the idea of the “Pac-Man rule” for informal conversations – this brings the Code of Conduct to the physical space by creating in-person interactions that are welcoming and inclusive. The idea is that when chatting, instead of standing in a closed circle with the person or people you are talking with, leave space for another person to join. It really worked at the conference: as I walked through the halls during coffee breaks I could approach anyone or group and have a positive, meaningful conversation. I do not think I have ever felt that at a conference before. Additionally, I was in numerous conversations where people joined the conversation saying “can I Pac-Man?” and they did and were no longer strangers since we shared this culture.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nJenny Bryan talks about “reducing friction” for analytical workflows as the motivation behind creating R packages from like reprex, usethis and googlesheets. And I would say that RStudio::conf was about reducing friction for people to feel included and confident to participate. With the Code of Conduct and Pac-Man, it was in person by asking a question or joining a conversation. Additionally, there were Birds of a Feather events throughout the week to bring together smaller communities, like R users in finance, academic research, education, edtech, and data for good. There were also buttons to wear and stickers for laptops and water bottles to have visible demonstrations of communities and tools. And, there was a large showing from and a meetup of the RLadies global community that promotes gender diversity in the R community.\nThere is a positive online #rstats community preceding the event and during the conference there were also ways to translate this welcoming feeling back online to include the #rstats community that could not attend, connect with each other across concurrent sessions, and strengthen relationships that could be continued after the conference was over. This was done through the #rstudioconf hashtag, presenters including Twitter handles, attendees live tweeting and retweeting each other, and by Karl Broman creating a list of all presentation slides. Further, the Tidyverse Developer Day on Saturday welcomed and helped people contribute to package development – and for many of us it was the first time making substantial contributions to open source projects. It was really empowering.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I describe RStudio::conf I find myself using words like “welcoming”, “intentional”, “design”, “positive”, and “Allison Horst’s art” alongside the awesome R tools that were presented (summarized in other blogs – see Karl’s full list of blog posts). The whole conference reminded me of Stef Butland’s rOpenSci post on the value of welcome. All of this creates a culture where sharing ideas and being open for feedback is safe, and it fosters innovation and kindness.\nWe have created a positive culture as a small lab team at the Ocean Health Index (OHI), and we welcome our OHI fellows to work this way with us as well. With Openscapes, I lead each Champions call modeled after the Mozilla Open Leaders program, which begins with a deliberate statement of our Community Participation Guidelines (similar to a Code of Conduct). Just this past week, we discussed lab culture, and why it is important to build trust and be intentional instead of hoping for positive culture to be organic (something I learned in Angela Bassa’s RStudio::conf talk).\nSo looking forward, how can we replicate this RStudio::conf tone and culture at other events? Codes of Conduct and Pac-Man rules can do lot at conferences, especially when they come from leadership. They are also effective in courses, labs, departments, and events on campus. But we can also be leaders and start asking for and modeling the behavior we want to see within academia so it becomes more of the norm. I am definitely motivated to do my part.\n \nCommunity stickers"

    "text": "What did the participants achieve?\nThis cohort was an opportunity for NOAA staff to explore and practice open data science approaches, but it was also an opportunity to meet and build relationships with folks across different parts of SEFSC, which has a wide geographic spread. Additionally, many folks have onboarded to NOAA during the ongoing pandemic and have not had the opportunity to meet many colleagues. It was exciting to see participants find alignment across NOAA missions, software, and supporting each other. Discussion topics were broad and also focused on the use of GitHub and Quarto for shared documentation. It was really inspiring to hear shared progress forward for more open and inclusive data science across the center. \nMany topics/themes that resonated with the 2022 SEFSC Summer Cohort overlapped and reinforced each other. SEFSC has recently undergone a Center-Wide Realignment, and many staff have extremely limited time during this transition, resulting in cautious voluntary enlistment to additional tasks and training. With the 2022 Summer Cohort, there was a resounding sense of camaraderie and dedication to putting in the effort now to improve workflows for the future. Here are a few examples from our Pathways Presentations during our final session: \n\nUsing GitHub as outward-facing and internal communication\nSEFSC’s Sustainable Fisheries Division (SFD) coordinates and conducts stock assessments involving many external partners throughout the southeast region, including 8 states, 4 US territories, and 3 regional management bodies. This complexity requires both the streamlined dissemination of assessment details and a dedicated location for communicating final assessment decisions internally. Skyler Sagarese participated in the 2021 Fall NMFS Cohort and built a GitHub page to track assessment details for coordination between the lead analyst and data compiler. This format was expanded and improved upon during the 2022 Summer SEFSC Cohort to facilitate collaboration between 2 SEFSC divisions and 4 branches involved in stock assessments for internal communications and distribution of details to external data providers for 2 Operational SEDAR Assessments - see figure below. The more staff that are trained to use these tools, the more streamlined and efficient our workflows become, improving employee morale and increasing assessment throughput.\n\n\n\n\nExample screenshot from the Sustainable Fisheries Division Assessment Workflow Team showing how they use GitHub for both an outward facing page and internal issue / progress tracking 😍\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating and documenting a communication plan\nThe Biology and Life History Branch within Fisheries, Assessment, Technology, and Engineering Support Division (FATES-BLH) documented their communication plan which acknowledged the areas where they are successful and identified areas for improvement (see figures below). Their branch has weekly meetings to strategize and track progress in real time, but is working to improve documentation of resulting products for easy and reproducible assessment inputs throughout SEFSC. Their team has been collaborating with SFD to receive assessment details through GitHub pages as well as collaborating within version-controlled programs, removing task redundancy and resulting in streamlined workflows. They are also working to document institutional knowledge and species-specific data issues, where the distribution of these details will vastly improve analyses and data inputs for stock assessments in the southeast. With SEFSC realignment, branches are spread throughout multiple cities in the southeast region, necessitating efficient communication and workflows.\n\n\n\n\nFATES-BLH Branch team communication plan which highlights current successes and areas for improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFATES-BLH Openscapes team in their new pathway!  SEFSC Staff are spread throughout multiple cities in the southeast region, but Openscapes has facilitated streamlined communication for all staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanning improvements for reports\nReports and analyses for Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (IEA) are often recurring or require edits to data inputs throughout the process. These workflows are spread throughout individuals’ Google folders and collaborators have been communicating via multiple email threads.  The Openscapes Cohort helped this team to envision a better future with open science tools including data extraction code stored on GitHub that feeds directly into Quarto reports (see figure below). They also envision tracking current data versions with auto-generated date tags, an improvement over many versions of the same product in individual workflows that are difficult to track. The IEA team documented this process and improvements for the SEFSC 2022 Summer Cohort; many teams at SEFSC are working through similar issues and striving towards the highest quality data and most efficient generation of reports. All teams found common ground in this effort, highlighting positive impacts of open science practices that facilitate inspiration, expand collaboration, and synergize our diverse expertise across the Center.\n\n\n\n\nIntegrated Ecosystem Assessment team pathway towards improved data quality through version control, streamlined communications, and automated reports."

    "text": "What did we learn & what are we doing now?\nWhen we agreed to be Openscapes mentors, we hoped that we would gain exposure to the overall Openscapes process including the logistics behind preparing for and supporting cohorts. We also wanted to spend time thinking about how we, as individuals, could integrate Openscapes practices and tools into our work. We got all of that and SO. MUCH. MORE!\nAfter our first preparatory conversation with Julie and Erin, our minds were full of ideas about how we could incorporate Openscapes tools, processes, and workflows into our daily work. One day Julie screenshared to show us how to use the R package Distill to create an event page for the FDD Cohort. We were then able to create the NMFS page on our own, and push it as a draft to GitHub so it was waiting for her to publish it. Not only seeing this was possible for the first time but then doing it ourselves really helped us see how this could be implemented in our own work. Plus, it was neat to collaborate so easily and use familiar technology (R) for writing, communication, and publishing. Corey was able to roll up a github.io webpage for an (at the time) upcoming California Trash Data Dive within days of that meeting. Anna began looking into how we could streamline, document, and automate our reporting and communication workflows. We haven’t developed any products for that work just yet - but conversations have begun and we plan on strategically implementing updated workflows in 2022!\nAs mentors we have been able to observe and support the FDD and NMFS cohorts, and we also learned a lot by hearing the discussions participants were having with their own messy/confidential/big data and contribute to those conversations with our own experience. Through that process we have learned and internalized some key lessons:\n\nOpenscapes is a mindset At first glance, Openscapes can seem like a sort of coding training series. While discussions and skill building opportunities (guest speakers, GitHub clinics, seaside chats, co-working sessions) make space for technical conversations and troubleshooting, the overall process is really about workflows. Openscapes provides a space and a structure for teams to temporarily pause their regular work discussions so they have the time and mental bandwidth to think through and talk about how they work, and how they can do it more openly, accessibly, and efficiently. Many of us might go through that sort of process on an individual level, but making space to have those conversations within and across teams - especially if individuals are from different organizations or agencies - can drastically broaden conversations and result in more holistic and streamlined solutions and communication pathways.\nWe are not alone! The datasets, details, and contexts around the work we do might be different - and that can often be the focus when we’re from the Water Boards and others are in the Fisheries Service. But the data and workflow challenges are remarkably similar, and when we discuss these challenges (and solutions!) together we can learn from each other and waste a whole lot less time than when we try to tackle the problems alone in our silos. Taking the time to increase the openness and transparency of our workflows helps improve processes and practices so they are more reproducible, transparent, inclusive, and kind.\nOnboarding can (and should!) be so much more than finding the bathroom All of us have gone through some form of an onboarding process: meet the team, meet with HR to complete your I-9 and health insurance forms, find your desk and, yes, find the bathroom. But how many of us are able to utilize that process to explicitly learn about work culture/expectations, and given an easy, one-stop-shop manual that describes how to find the data and resources relevant to our work, and how to add/contribute to those resources over time so that it’s up-to-date and augmented with our perspective for the next person. Dedicating time to think through and document the components of your workflow that are described in the Openscapes Pathway document can help streamline onboarding and offboarding processes as well as serve as a resource and reminder to folks that have been on the team for a while (including future us!). Better still - there are already a number of past Openscapes teams that have developed these types of documents in an open format that can be used as a template or inspiration for any documentation you want to create (Faylab Manual = GOLD)!\nGoing through the Openscapes process is an investment Many of us are already juggling too many things in the work we do and the thought of adding another ball in the air can feel daunting…impossible even. It does take time and energy to go through the Openscapes process. This is not a passive experience (i.e. it’s not a webinar or a meeting to show up to). Getting everything you can out of Openscapes requires active engagement during calls and working together in between calls, which teams do through Seaside Chats. Giving ourselves and our teams the time and space to do so can significantly improve workflows and efficiency immediately and down the road. The potential returns on this investment in time and focus are massive - IF we, as individuals and as teams, fully commit ourselves to the process."

    "text": "What did “assisting” look like for us?\nWhen Julie and Erin asked us to be mentors they let us determine the depth and breadth of that commitment. We could choose to take a light touch approach or we could dive in, but they were clear that we wouldn’t be “shadowing” - we would be assisting through contributing to the cohort during, before, and after calls. This meant that we’d learn by doing, which is exactly what we were hoping for since we wanted to use the experience to prepare ourselves to lead our own Cohort at the Water Boards.\nWe have some experience with meeting and event facilitation so we know from personal experience that getting one additional person to provide simple tech support or help with note taking can significantly lighten the load for the main meeting facilitator and speakers during the meeting. Moreover, providing that assistance doesn’t take that much preparation or time so long as we are available during the meeting time - we were happy to take on those roles during Cohort calls.\nBecause of our interest in learning as much as we could about the logistics of leading or supporting the Openscapes process at the Water Boards, we choose to take on a little more than the minimum mentor responsibilities. We elected to take the lead on writing up the meeting summaries (Digests) after each cohort call and attend Seaside Chats with Julie, Erin, and other mentors before the beginning of the cohorts, in between cohort calls, and after the last cohort call. Writing up the Digests did take some time but because Julie and Erin already have templates and examples for everything (seriously…everything!) adding this to our mentor workload didn’t feel like a heavy lift. The Seaside Chats were hands-on training opportunities for us. Julie and Erin walked us through the Openscapes process, prepared us for any upcoming mentor responsibilities, shared resources, and made time for skill building - we even got our own GitHub clinic! Julie and Erin said this was a great opportunity for them to practice since they were iterating the order and length of the GitHub Clinic.\nCommitting time and energy to assist with Openscapes Champions Cohorts is not inconsequential - but it feels like a bargain! We get to observe Openscapes pros do their amazing work, learn from their expertise and resources, and connect with and learn from cohort speakers and teams for only 1-3 hours of commitment each week. This table shows our time commitments for 2021, and this will be the starting point as we develop plans for 2022 as well!\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\nTime commitment\n\n\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nSeaside chats\n\n(pre-cohort)\n\n\n1 hour/chat; 3 chats total\n\n\nEvery other week (started 2 months before Cohort Calls)\n\n\n\n\nCohort Calls & GitHub Clinic (logistical support)\n\n\n1.5 hours/call; 4 calls total\n\n\nEvery other week (alternating with Seaside chats)\n\n\n\n\nCohort Digests\n\n\n~1.5 hrs/Digest; 4 total\n\n\nEvery other week, a day or so after each Cohort Call\n\n\n\n\nSeaside chats\n\n(during & post-cohort)\n\n\n1 hour/call; 6 chats total\n\n\nEvery other week (ended 2 months after the last Cohort Call)"

We are looking forward to attending and supporting the 3-month check-in with our respective Champions Cohorts to see how those teams have been doing and learning from the progress they will have made.\nFrom an organizational perspective - we’re all about paying it forward. We want to share what we have learned, and the Openscapes process as a whole with the Water Boards and our partners. The details of how we are going to make this happen are still in progress but we do intend to lead a small cohort of folks at the Water Boards through the Openscapes Champions Program. We are looking forward to working with Julie and Erin to contribute to the Openscapes Approach Guide to document what we learn through this process so others can do the same in the future. Finally, and most importantly, we are looking forward to joining the rest of the awesome Openscapes Community to create a positive open culture in our teams, organizations, and networks to enable better, more equitable, and kinder science in less time!\n \n\nPhoto by Julie Lowndes."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Our First 2022 Openscapes Community Call featured a chat with Beth Duckles PhD, a research consultant and social scientist. Beth helps technologists, designers and scientists gather and use human-centered data, supporting folks who are trying out their mixed methods or qualitative skills and want coaching and partnership. Beth is also the Founder and Co-Director of Open Post Academics (formerly the Athenas), an online peer-support community for people with a PhD who have left or are considering leaving academia. The recording is on Openscapes YouTube.\nOur conversation was about Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) - what it is and how it can be used for evaluation. Specifically, we talked about how it can be used to evaluate the Openscapes Champions program. We had some funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to experiment with this.\nWhat is QDA? This slide from a talk about Qualitative Research Using Open Tools with Beth and Vicky Rampin (nee Steeves) provides a short summary: \n\nQDA is the systematic collection, organization and interpretation of unstructured data (e.g. interview transcripts, public documents, focus groups, open-ended survey questions). After a close reading of the qualitative data, researchers will assign “codes” or themes to relevant quotes and/or sections of video/audio/images.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n“Coding” in the context of QDA means tagging the textual data to reveal patterns in the data or annotating the data with tags that can be used for analysis.\nA qualitative lesson for quantitative researchers: Small amounts of qualitative work can make your quantitative work better! For example, before you create a multiple choice question in a survey, be sure you know what types of responses people want to give, or you’ll collect bad data by restricting their answers. Do some QDA first!\nBeth has been working with Openscapes to explore how QDA methods can be used with our Google Doc Agendas to evaluate learning over time. One of the first things we learned was that the time scale of our Theory of Change was too big for the timescale of a Champions cohort.\nOur work did discover some themes in the agendas we looked at such as the challenge of having enough time (Do I have time to do x?), “Writing things down” (where and how the data is stored), and the challenges of onboarding/offboarding folks coming in and out of labs. This information can help us anticipate the needs of future Cohorts and adapt accordingly.\nLearn more from Beth’s work: \n\nWebsite: https://bethduckles.com \nOPA:  https://openpostac.org/ \nUpcoming workshops and mailing list: https://bethduckles.podia.com/\n\nBeth will be doing a free Intro to Qualitative Research if you’d like to join in on May 10th at 3pm PST. \nShe will also be running a four week course on Qualitative Research for Quantitative Researchers in May!\n\nWorkshop materials on Zenodo: \n\nOnline Workshop on Facilitating Online Workshops\nIntroduction to Qualitative Research for Quantitative Researchers \nToolkit for Cross-Disciplinary Workshops from OPA)\nQualitative Research Using Open Tools with Vicky Rampin (nee Steeves)\nTaguette: Free Open Source QDA Coding Tool \nQcoder: R package for QDA"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Our 3rd Openscapes Community Call featured a chat with Dr. Alison Hill, product manager for data science communication at RStudio. Alison is a data scientist, behavioral scientist, and award-winning educator and we were thrilled to chat with her! The recording is on Openscapes YouTube.\nOur conversation was about why we are so enthused with R Markdown, and why we think it is so transformative for scientists. We discussed two main themes (thinking that this would be an introduction to R Markdown, a first of three conversations):\n\nR Markdown helps us iterate while we work, since our code, outputs (figures and tables), and text are all in the same place. This means that instead of those things being in separate places (and our brains being in separate places), it’s more efficient to develop and document our analyses as we go — and no more copy-pasting figures into a different document!\nR Markdown has changed how we approach science communication and publishing since we can create not only Word documents and PDFs but also webpages, websites, e-books, slides, and more as a part of our daily workflows. This ability to openly share your work has been transformational for Openscapes, and played a foundational role in the whole design and how we work on a daily basis (see related: Data science as an entryway to open publishing, Lowndes & Tierney 2020)\n\nThere was a lot conversation in the chat and also discussed out loud as a Q&A with Alison. One big theme was about modularization and how to keep R Markdown documents from becoming too unruly. Strategies included writing R code in functions or separate scripts that are called into the R Markdown document through a code chunk, or writing child documents that are knit into the main document.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs always, it was a pleasure to chat with Alison! Looking forward for further chats. Thanks so much for all you do!"

While sad to conclude, all Champion labs have so many exciting accomplishments and so much momentum for open data science, and it is truly just the beginning. Here we are posting individual case studies of accomplishments from Champions labs.\n\nThe Stier Lab at the University of California at Santa Barbara studies the resilience of harvested ocean ecosystems, with a lab culture built on the values of trust, providing and receiving critical feedback from each other, and realizing that everyone has a unique perspective and brings valuable insights to the table. Participating in Openscapes is Professor Adrian Stier and PhD students Lily Zhao and Bart Difiore.\n\nAdrian: Openscapes was nebulous at first to me, I’d heard about lots of the tools and concepts we’ve covered, but I never had a chance to implement a lot of them. Openscapes has been a critical opportunity to establish a workflow for my lab integrating code, writing, presentations, and communication. We now work hard to integrate all of our files into one place (Google Drive) and to produce reproducible code that is carefully annotated and easily read for each of our given projects.\nLily: When I first heard about Openscapes and Julie’s work as Mozilla fellow I was excited to have the opportunity through the lab to join the inaugural cohort! I expected to be learning GitHub and open-data science tips but what I hadn’t expected was the ability to engage across lab groups around the country in a dialogue about the philosophy behind open data science and how to promote it on multiple scales.\nBart: Before joining Openscapes, my impression was that open data science was little more than providing data accessibility upon publication. Julie and the inaugural openscapes cohort offering me a much deeper understanding of the open science philosophy, and the Openscapes discussions led to a complete renovation of our lab data policies. What I think was so valuable is that now I not only feel as though our research has become more accessible for others, the efficiency of how I do day-to-day tasks and collaborations has dramatically improved.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeach lab meeting, via @oceanrecoveries\n\n\n\nThe Stier Lab Case Study shares our accomplishments for increasing access among our lab group by migrating our daily workflows through a shared Google Drive. By sharing our files with each other regardless of the stage of work required having open conversations with each other about trust, humility, and the philosophy behind this type of openness within the lab group. As a preview:\n\n\n“I learned that brute force and more hours doesn’t make better science. Rather, taking the time to come up with a plan and adjust workflows can save countless hours in the long run and dramatically improve the reproducibility – and therefore the credibility – of our work.” — Bart Difiore\n\n\nOur key accomplishments are:\n\nEstablish Google Drive to share files, presentations, data, documentation\nConstructed Github Organization for the lab\nStreamlined Slack as a communication tool\nUse Trello for lab management\nIntegrate notes for meeting minutes through Google Docs\nEngage in open data science and #rstats Twitter community\n\n\nCongratulations Adrian, Lily, Bart, and the rest of the Stier Lab!\n\n\nRelevant posts:\n\nOpenscapes Champions incorporate open practices in their science\nOpenscapes summit reflections — becoming champions\nOpenscapes summit reflections 2 — Changing the way we do science"

    "title": "Learning by doing: migrating to Quarto from Bookdown",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I just had rather a lot of fun working with Ileana Fenwick to convert a book to Quarto from RMarkdown! Given that Quarto is relatively new and there’s not yet an excess of resources beyond the official docs, we’ve documented how we did it.\nFirst, what is Quarto? It is a new open-source scientific and technical publishing system, building on ten years of what RStudio learned from RMarkdown, and extends these features beyond R. While RMarkdown isn’t going away, we have been transitioning some RMarkdown projects to Quarto so that there is a consistent way to contribute, whether folks are familiar with R, Python, or new to this kind of open-science workflow all together.\nAnd what was the fun about? Lots of things. The book we converted is Gavin Fay’s outstanding onboarding documentation, the Faylab Lab Manual. The technical work was at the right level of new-ness and challenge for us and we approached it by coworking and screensharing over a few sessions before moving to asynchronous work. Plus, most often when we tried something it “just worked” because Quarto can handle RMarkdown and this book was mostly prose and screenshots without any R (or Python) code.\nThere is joy in our commits!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe started by familiarizing ourselves through Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel’s “Reproducible authoring with Quarto” (slides, YouTube), Danielle Navarro’s “Porting a distill blog to quarto”, and Nick Tierney’s Notes on Changing from Rmarkdown/Bookdown to Quarto. In June, we participated in the Community Call, A Quarto Chat with NASA Openscapes, co-hosted with R-Ladies Santa Barbara. It was relatively straightforward to figure basic things out by searching the Quarto documentation, coming back to those resources, and checking out the GitHub sources of other Quarto books to see how others have set things up.\nHere’s the GitHub view of the Faylab Lab Manual before and after migration. As is the Openscapes practice, we documented what we did - for Future Us and for you - in the Bookdown to Quarto section of our open-source tutorial, Making shareable documents with Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs is also the Openscapes practice, I’m learning (… trying to learn) to embrace “done for now, not perfect”. “Making shareable documents with Quarto” is a living document in which we aim to describe things as clearly as possible in the time we have, share it with others, and improve as we come back to it. If we wait till we have time to write flawless docs, it’ll never happen. This is such a safe place to grow one’s comfort zone!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis migration took us about 19 combined hours, which includes time reading, learning, trying things, and fixing things. This also includes learning that when you fork a repo and then make a branch, by default the branch’s pull request goes to the original repo not your fork (d’oh!). Our GitHub Action to render the Faylab Lab Manual failed initially because we had a piece of R code - even though the code was commented out! That was resolved when we deleted the line. On the plus side, we saw the ease of adding citations via DOI in the RStudio Visual Editor (tutorial; YouTube). The time spent learning is already paying off as I (Stef) contribute to our other open documentation in Quarto, like our Guide to the Openscapes Approach (GitHub).\nIf you’d like to become more familiar with Quarto, we hope this post helps. You can also try our Quarto website tutorial, which we’ve been developing as we’ve learned and taught others. See something that needs improving? Open a GitHub issue to tell us about it (the tutorial will point you to resources for creating an account if this is your first time). Or remix it by forking, adapting, and citing the repo.\nThanks to Gavin Fay, an Openscapes Champion, for allowing us to experiment and learn by migrating his inspiring lab manual, and to Julie Lowndes, Openscapes Director, for guiding us along the way!"

    "text": "From Spring 2022-2023 I have had the pleasure of being a Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellow, by the Exascale Computing Project (17-SC-20-SC), a collaborative effort of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration; and by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant No. 2154495. This is an excerpt from my final progress report to the The Krell Institute, who administered this award.\nQuick links:\n\nHow Open Source Tooling Is Changing the Way Professional Researchers Learn to Code - my post on the BSSw blog\n\n\nMy focus during the fellowship was to support environmental science researchers through open source software that we share on GitHub. I modernized Openscapes’ open educational resources that I first built with RMarkdown by refactoring them in Quarto, and we have since used these updated resources to teach 6 cohorts (50 teams) of professional environmental and Earth scientists at NASA, NOAA, and the EPA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the Openscapes Champions Lesson Series website.\n\nI shared about this work with the BSSw community in two main ways. First, through a presentation for the Exascale Computing Project HPC webinar (slides). This talk had three parts:\n\nMovement building: share Openscapes stories of open science for climate;\nSkill building: Quarto live demo;\nOnward: how you can help your colleagues and join the movement.\n\nThis talk also explicitly addressed: why is this relevant to the Exascale community? It is relevant because computing skills are critical for science & society; we’re hampered by inequity. Let’s change this. Some references that frame this thinking:\n\nUnmet needs for analyzing biological big data - Barone et al. 2017\nBarriers to integration of bioinformatics into undergrad life sci education - Williams et al. 2019\n“Technology can exacerbate inequities if the corresponding social infrastructure is not in place\" - Benjamin 2022\n\nSecond, I wrote a blog posted at https://bssw.io/blog_posts/how-open-source-tooling-is-changing-the-way-professional-researchers-learn-to-code. An excerpt from that blog:\n\nThe same open source tooling that is changing how we do science — R, Python, Git, GitHub — is changing the way we teach professional researchers how to code.\nTooling like Jupyter Notebooks, RMarkdown, and now Quarto enables researchers to combine narrative, code, and outputs like figures in the same document, enabling transparent and reproducible workflows that can be shared openly on GitHub. This same setup can be used to teach professional researchers to code so that the teaching narrative unfolds interspersed with code the learner can run. Because the resources are openly available, and learners can work and learn with the same tools used to create those resources, there is consistency between what they see in the materials they learn from, what they see on their end, and the expected outcomes. But what is truly remarkable is the culture shift enabled by this setup; learners have in front of them these documents that reinforce what the teacher screen shares live, and which continue to be there for reference and self-paced learning when the teacher isn’t there at all. This approach builds trust and resilience with learners, and role-models a new way of working openly — all of this is a paradigm shift for how professional researchers learn new skills, work, and then teach others in turn.\n\nThank you for this opportunity as a BSSw Fellow to learn more with the open source and Better Scientific Software communities! I appreciate all the work that goes into open infrastructure – both technical and social – as well as development and teaching. I’m looking forward to staying connected and seeing what this community continues to do!\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{lowndes2023,\n  author = {Julie Lowndes},\n  title = {Notes from My {Better} {Scientific} {Software} {(BSSw)}\n    {Fellowship}},\n  date = {2023-08-17},\n  url = {https://openscapes.org/blog/2023-08-17-bssw-fellowship/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nJulie Lowndes. 2023. “Notes from My Better Scientific Software\n(BSSw) Fellowship.” August 17, 2023. https://openscapes.org/blog/2023-08-17-bssw-fellowship/."

    "text": "Champions Case Study: Therkildsen Lab\nWe have just concluded our inaugural cohort of Openscapes Champions. While sad to conclude, all Champion labs have so many exciting accomplishments and so much momentum for open data science, and it is truly just the beginning. Here we are posting individual case studies of accomplishments from Champions labs.\n\nThe Therkildsen Lab at Cornell University studies conservation genomics and molecular ecology. Our research aims to improve our understanding of how species adapt to their environment, and how quickly they can respond to altered conditions caused by selective harvest, climate change, or other anthropogenic pressures. Participating in Openscapes is Professor Nina Therkildsen and PhD students Maria Akopyan and Nicolas Lou, and post doc Arne Jacobs.\n\nNina: With a desire to always find optimal solutions, I had initially felt very overwhelmed by the jungle of tools available out there to help promote open science, and the resulting insecurity about where to start prevented me from starting at all. A key thing Openscapes has illustrated to me, is that there obvious is not one single solution that will work best for all aspects of our work. But also, that we don’t have to completely change everything we do all at once. There are lots of little modular ways in which we can start to improve our workflows, and over time these will build on each other to really make a big difference in how efficiently and transparently we operate.\nNicolas: One key understanding for me is that I learned spending some extra time to make my workflow readable and tractable can really help me save more time in the long run. One other thing: I found that some tools that were initially developed for the industry (e.g. GitHub and Slack) can be quite helpful to the academia as well.\nArne: The two key points I have taken away from this experience is to spend more time making my analyses and workflow more easily accessible for others (and my future self) as this will increase the impact of my work and will save time in the long run. I have also learned that it is okay to share my workflow with the lab and the wider scientific community even if it is not perfect and that this will ultimately improve my work, a point I have struggled with and still struggle with. It ultimately taught me that we all seem to struggle with similar things.\nMaria: Dedicating time to discuss data openness, workflow reproducibility, and a lab code of conduct was extremely valuable. I think it strengthened the sense of community and accountability in our lab, and has helped set a foundation upon which we can continue to slowly build our better data practices.\n\n\n\n\nThe Therkildsen Lab Case Study shares our accomplishments and plans moving forward to continue the process of getting all our analysis scripts on Github. Moving forward, for all new papers coming out of the lab, the full data analysis pipeline, including the code to reproduce all results and figures, must be made available in a well organized way in a Github repository. This requires a big change of habit, but the benefits are so obvious to us that we are committed to the challenge. As a preview:\n\n\n“Openscapes provided a really useful framework for us that boosted our motivation to transition towards more open and reproducible workflows, provided technical guidance and support to make the barriers to entry seem less daunting, included bi-weekly accountability to a supportive and driven group that kept us focused on the process even when the semester had us very busy with other tasks, and both the direct program material and the community of champion labs gave us lots of inspiration for how we want to organize our workflows and data management better in the future.” — Therkildsen lab\n\n\nOur key accomplishments are:\n\nWe have backed up all of our raw data on a secure server.\nWe have started to use Google Drive to keep track of our sample and sequence metadata, lab notes, as well as experiment protocols (instead of having various randomly named files scattered across everybody’s personal computers).\nWe have transitioned to use Slack as our primary online communication tool (instead of email). We like it a lot because it lowers the barrier to initiate conservations and helps to facilitate collaboration among lab members. We also found the various features in Slack very helpful in keeping our communication organized by having channels for specific purposes and keeping track of prior discussions and lab results results by having all prior conversation and image sharing on a topic listed in one place with the ability to reference previous comments, star and pin items, and etc.\nWe have incorporated GitHub as a central part of our workflow: github.com/therkildsen-lab. We have made our central data processing pipeline and part of the data analysis pipeline available on GitHub, have made the pipeline flexible to the need of other users, and have provided clear documentation, so that our collaborators (and our future selves) can easily access it without the need to reinvent the wheel. In addition, we have started to keep track of our entire analysis pipeline and result visualization using GitHub as well, enabling more efficient communication among lab members on various projects. We have also recommended (and taught) GitHub to some collaborators and colleagues.\nWe have come up with a lab code of conduct.\n\n\nCongratulations Nina, Nicolas, Arne, Maria, and the rest of the Therkildsen Lab!\n\n\nRelevant posts:\n\nOpenscapes Champions incorporate open practices in their science\nOpenscapes summit reflections — becoming champions\nOpenscapes summit reflections 2 — Changing the way we do science"

    "text": "Last week NASA led an Open Source Science for Data Processing and Archives Workshop, announcing new initiatives to support open science. This was very exciting to be a part of — we learned about NASA’s continuing leadership in open science and presented some of our work with Openscapes. This is a brief summary, and will be updated with links to slides and recordings.\n\nAt the October 14 NASA Open Source Science for Data Processing and Archives Workshop, the Science Mission Directorate shared their vision to enable transformational open science through continuous evolution of science data and computing systems for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. This vision has three goals:\n\nDevelop and Implement Capabilities to Enable Open Science\nContinuous Evolution of Data and Computing Systems\nHarness the Community and Strategic Partnerships for Innovation\n\nAs part of this, they introduced Transform to Open Science (TOPS), a program to increase understanding and adoption of open science principles and techniques. TOPS will focus on capacity building, partner engagement, and incentives to help accelerate scientific discovery through open science, with USD$20 million per year for five years to support these efforts. Below is one graphic from the presentation, and a few twitter threads live during the event from @AstroCrawford @ReaderMeter.\n\n\n \n\nHighlighing NASA’s priorities through the Transform to Open Science program\n\n\n\nAs part of the NASA Open Source Science Highlights, along with Data Catalog, Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning (AI/ML), Prizes and Challenges, Citizen Science, and Astrophysics Data Systems, we gave a brief overview about Openscapes. We introduced the Champions Program and our work engaging, empowering, and amplifying research teams. We also highlighted our work with the Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAAC) Mentor Cohort, who are supporting researchers as they transition to open science workflows on the Cloud (see nasa-openscapes.github.io. The DAAC Mentors are hosting a Cloud Hackathon next month, an AGU workshop in December, and a Champions Cohort in early 2022!\n\n\n \n\nA slide from our presentation; artwork by @allison_horst\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of inclusive open science momentum going on and we’re really excited to be a part of it!"

    "text": "2019 Review\n2019 was a big year for Openscapes, full of firsts, excitement, and a lot of learning. I created Openscapes through my fellowship with Mozilla, developing the Champions curriculum building from six years of better science in less time with the Ocean Health Index and designing the Champions program modeled after the Mozilla Open Leaders program. I also leveraged my own open data science skills and online, community-based learning, building Openscapes’ digital infrastructure in R, RMarkdown, and GitHub. I also had the awesome experience of working with NCEAS (and now also RStudio) Artist-in-Resident Allison Horst, who created all of our original artwork for Openscapes. We officially launched Openscapes at the end of 2018, at MozFest in London.\nFrom January-May 2019, we led the first cohort of Openscapes Champions: seven research groups from five universities studying critical topics like marine food systems and ecological vectors of disease. During that time we focused on developing the lesson series, mentoring scientists each month (both one-on-one and as a full cohort of seven research groups), and amplifying their work and progress through blog posts and Twitter @openscapes. These science teams had so many wins and momentum during those five months, and still continue to strengthen culture and workflows around open data science. We continue to amplify their stories.\nThe rest of 2019 was focused on sharing lessons from Openscapes and championing open data science broadly to many audiences. I gave the opening keynote at the useR! 2019 conference in Toulouse, France and co-authored a career column in Nature with the Champions group leads, sharing a ten-week plan for how to get started with open data science. I also published a piece in Scientific American about how open data science enables kinder culture — better for science and better for scientists. As my Mozilla Fellowship support ended I have been funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, also focusing time developing a strategic plan and fundraising to continue Openscapes in 2020 and beyond."

This is what we love to do: mentor science teams and welcome them to open data science tools and communities. And leading more Champions cohorts is the future of Openscapes. Mozilla sponsored the first cohort of Openscapes Champions, and future cohorts can be sponsored or booked directly. There are several Champions cohorts that are in the works for direct booking — learn more and email us if you are interested too! We are also leading our first 2-day Openscapes workshop in February, which will be an exciting way to catalyze open data science with cohorts of research groups in a familiar setting.\nCommunity engagement. Openscapes is all about building and strengthening communities of practice around open data science, and in 2020 we are excited to be able to focus on this more. We have ideas but also are excited to enable the ideas of others, so if you are interested please get in touch.\nChampioning open data science. We have several exciting invited talks and keynotes coming up this year, stay tuned for more posts with official announcements! We are excited for the opportunity to share our stories and to meet more open data science allies.\nIt’s going to be an exciting year, thanks for being a part of it."

If you do it yourself, this involves creating an AWS Account, connecting to an EC2 instance, and using resources like the Earthdata Cloud Primer for more setup and cost management information. If you use a managed Cloud service, organizations like 2i2c can provide Cloud-hosted JupyterHubs for research and education. Your institution may also support smaller or larger scale options."

While the script was run from Amy’s local computer, the data processing steps were run on the Cloud using Coiled Functions for running Python functions on Cloud virtual machines (VMs). This approach was particularly convenient as it allows existing Python functions to be run in the Cloud by lightly annotating them with a @coiled.function decorator.\nThis workflow benefited from running on the Cloud because the ICESat-2 mission data was already stored on the Cloud in S3, so moving the data processing to be co-located next to the data avoided data transfers, which are both slow and expensive."

This post focuses on what the cohort setup and participants achieved. It is co-authored with Eli, Eric Ward, and Hélène Scalliet from NOAA NWFSC, who coordinated the cohort, and Corey Clatterbuck from California Waterboards, who assisted.

    "text": "NMFS Cohort setup and structure\nWe worked with Eric Ward earlier this year to lead the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) cohort with fisheries researchers from Seattle. We were keen to lead a second one to follow up and expand the participation with Openscapes, and were able to include researchers from four different fisheries science centers in the Southeast (SEFSC), Northeast (NEFSC), Northwest (NWFSC), and Alaska (AFSC). We iterated the Champions program based on what we learned from leading three cohorts in the spring, as we described in a separate post about Fall Cohorts. We were excited for this mix of new and returning champions and interested to support them to make progress on their open data science pathway, no matter where they were starting from.\nDuring the Openscapes Champions sessions, the entire cohort discussed inefficiencies, reproducibility and documentation problems and other team roadblocks in their current scientific workflows. The teaching component of each session involved training in reproducible workflow, team culture, and structuring open team communities that can collaborate effectively with the current and future selves.\nTwo guest teachers shared about their open data science efforts at NOAA. Emily Markowitz (NOAA AFSC) shared how the AFSC is using RMarkdown to automate stock assessment reports to improve efficiency, reproducibility and reduce report errors (slides: Data to Product Workflows). Chanté Davis (NOAA Fisheries’ West Coast Region) shared about how the West Coast Region has approached staff training in R to increase efficiency in development of WCR reports and response to data requests (slides:Expanding OuR Communities). Emily said that with R Markdown workflows for making reports: “We will never guess again” and that it saves so much time and emailing to track things down. Chanté said “Don’t R alone!” and that R has to be in your work plan. She suggests approaching & mapping project management and workflows like a recipe: What is the end product? What are the steps to create the end product? Which of these steps can be automated?\nIn between the Champions sessions, the cohort learned the in-and-outs of using RStudio, Git and GitHub for team and project management with clinics and 1-on-1 sessions with Eli. Each team also met separately to work on their on goals for improving the team workflow during Seaside Chats (AFSC example), using GitHub Issues and Pathways documents as a way to organize together."

    "text": "What did the participants achieve?\nThis cohort was an opportunity for NOAA staff to explore and practice open data science approaches, but it was also an opportunity to meet and build relationships with folks from different fisheries science centers. It was exciting to see participants discuss common pain points and learn from each other about strategies that could be reused across centers. Discussion topics included strategies to help diverse teams develop strategies for using GitHub together and organizing R code, as well as articulating differences between final NOAA products vs ongoing work/projects and how open science relates to both.\nMany topics/themes that resonated with the 2021 NOAA NMFS Cohort overlapped and reinforced each other. Here are a few examples:\nDocumenting onboarding & offboarding processes. Investing time to formally document onboarding and offboarding processes (for federal employees as well as contractors) was a big topic. Both are important to capture institutional knowledge and critical to prepare both for folks leaving their positions and for new folks joining the team. Written documents help others get up to speed faster, and find available datasets, data description guides, and methodologies. It’s critical that they are easily accessible and updatable “living documents” for core or team processes that may occur infrequently.\nGitHub projects. While multiple tools for project collaboration and management exist, this cohort was particularly enthusiastic to learn more about Github projects. The cohort noticed that Github projects are easily used by team members who have different skill sets, job titles, and areas of expertise. Teams started offering other ways to contribute, including discussion boards, Github issues, and Slack. These tools enable asynchronous collaboration that goes “beyond the meetings” and can improve hybrid working conditions. GitHub’s Project Boards{beta} were release just as our cohort ended and Paul McElhaney (NWFSC) shared examples of how it could be used by NOAA teams. Some potential uses for GitHub Projects included:\n\nOrganize and track data request tasks\nCoordinate on/offboarding efforts\nHands-on workflow practice and use using Github\n\n\n\n\n\nNWFSC Ocean Acidification Group’s GitHub Project Board, see other examples on the NMFS-Openscapes Wiki.\n\n\n\nStrategies for community building. Collaboration is essential within teams and with external partners, but collaborating with people around new technology is challenging and takes time. Discussing next steps for carrying this work forward, one participant summarized it as “not just skills, also culture”, and that helping folks get excited is worth the effort. Strategies included show-by-doing (screensharing), co-working, office hours, and bringing down silos of people who are used to working with (beyond job titles). This includes sharing work earlier (not waiting for work to be perfect-ish before sharing) and building better shared relationships with Google folders.\n\n“We want to change ‘our next steps’ to ‘our now’” - NMFS team member\n\nnmfs-openscapes GitHub Organization. Eli Holmes (NWFSC) and Em Markowitz (AFSC) have spear-headed the nmfs-openscapes GitHub Organization to help coordinate and give visibility to all the open data science work at NMFS — and beyond (see R-Govys. We especially love the Wiki, a growing resource with examples ofGitHub in gov andproject boards.\n\nThe NOAA-NMFS Champions Cohort was really a thoughtful and dedicated group, and are so excited for the momentum at NOAA NMFS. The following is a bit more about each NMFS team in the Cohort. And look out for further blogs about what the Openscapes team learned and what’s coming next."

When we see things, it is easier to value them.\nOpenscapes Champion Allison Horst is doing this in part through her personifyr art series. She uses her art in the classroom at the University of California at Santa Barbara, where she is a lecturer of data science and statistics in an environmentally-focused graduate program, the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. She also shares the series online, to the delight of the #rstats Twitter community (for example, see here, and check out the comments!). Through the personifyr series, Allison personifies different operations done in the programming language R. What is so powerful is that you do not have to be an expert in R or know these packages to get a sense of what they do, in a lighthearted and quite joyful way. For example,\nggplot2 creates beautiful visualizations to explore data…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…and as final publication-worthy products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngganimate lets you animate those graphics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlubridate helps you work with dates and times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsf simplifies working with spatial data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreprex makes asking for help more helpful\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhere makes working with filepaths a dream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRMarkdown combines text and code into beautiful reports like magic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR is an open source language with increasing functionality available at lower start up costs for new users. This is because of recently established norms and best practices developed by the diverse and inclusive online R community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllison’s art represents these R operations and the spirit of the online community, who have appreciated her and asked for permission to use in their own classrooms. She enthusiastically encourages this, sharing all her stats art online along with the statement:\n\n\n“All of this artwork is 100% available (and encouraged!) for open use by CC-BY license. That means: Hooray! I’m so happy that you want to share this artwork - especially if it helps when teaching R/rstats/stats.”\n\n\nI am so impressed by the personifyr series in so many ways. Not only by Allison’s artistic talent, which is broad and deep, spanning styles and media (fine art and digital) in ways I appreciate but do not have the vocabulary to describe. But I am also so impressed by her ability to break down and communicate complex topics, and her creativity in representing it all in such an engaging and colorful way. To imagine these programming operations as personalities, and to bring to life what they would be doing is such an incredible skill, full stop. And then additionally to have the artistic ability to match is such a gift to us all. What a powerful way to engage the community of R users and data scientists, and welcome the others, including environmental scientists, to see and value these practices as well.\nEnjoy Allison’s full personifyr series — and more — here."

Photo by @goknurginer, all artwork by @allison_horst\n\n\n\nMy keynote talk was called “R for better science in less time” and is about how open software and teamwork can supercharge environmental science. And specifically, how R as a language and as a community have been so impactful on my science and on my life, so that now I am focused on passing forward what I’ve learned. While the message is relevant to many different fields, I focus on environmental science because that is where my expertise lies as a marine-scientist-turned-marine-data-scientist, and that is where there is a pressing need as scientists tackle how humans can live sustainably in a changing climate.\nIn my keynote I shared a lot about Openscapes and what motivates the Champions mentorship program. That motivation comes from my own experience struggling with data (both alone and with collaborators) and getting through it with mentorship and teamwork, centered around open data science. My three big take-homes were that open data science is a mindset, that teamwork starts with openness, and that to be most effective we should harness the power of welcome. I won’t build out those lessons learned here, but I will highlight some of what motivates my work — see options above to read and watch the whole story (or check out @fmic_’s live-tweets!).\nBut first I wanted to say thank you again to everyone that helped me prepare for the talk. In particular, thank you Allison Horst, who coached me weekly and designed beautiful, original artwork to help convey my ideas. And thank you also to Yihui Xie, JJ Allaire et al for the RMarkdown suite: I made the slides in R using xaringan, and published them on GitHub gh-pages. #opendatascience and #teamwork #forthewin."

The center of this illustration (the import > tidy > transform/visualize/model > communicate cycle that accompanies Wickham & Grolemund’s definition of data science) here is ringed by communities and support that supercharge innovation and teamwork. These are the communities that my Ocean Health Index team has found so critical to our success.\nThis complete picture is so important for the amazing scientists studying climate changes’ affects on the environment (including food security and disease transmission). But currently this is not the norm.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, environmental science looks like this. We are rarely taught how to work responsibly with data or have formal training with coding or computing, which leaves us largely on our own to learn how to analyze our data. This means scientists learn on their own in pockets of opportunity but are largely unsupported at broader institutional levels, and we spend a lot of time struggling and reinventing the wheels of data analysis when we are trying to be focused on science questions (see this excellent publication by Hampton et al 2017). And often scientists are not supported even at level of the research group, which is already a science team and should be so in terms of data.\nHelping complete this picture drives my work now. Openscapes is all about how to best complete this picture by introducing open data science and teamwork to supercharge scientific research."

    "section": "Open data science — teamwork feedback loop",
    "text": "Open data science — teamwork feedback loop\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen data science and teamwork are so powerful together, and I’ve been thinking about them together as a beautiful feedback loop. Starting on the left: learning and using similar open software promotes and streamlines teamwork. And from the right: working as a team better equips you to learn open practices data science.\nFor example, using shared conventions like the tidyverse in R can reduce friction when it comes to running each others’ code, which can then open up time for more thoughtful suggestions and collaboration. The relationships and trust built within the team from these experiences can prime them to improve upon their workflows — they might be more willing to introduce GitHub to their team as a way to reduce the friction that comes from from file-sharing. This will then make it easier to onboard new members to the team, and continue strengthen relationships and skillsets.\nThis is a loop that feeds back on itself, which each fueling the other. Maybe it’s more like a spiral, because it gets tighter and tighter? I think that this is really what is going on in the central portion of the environmental open data science illustration above: those communities ringing the data science workflow. It’s this feedback and this fueling that is so powerful, and it is not limited to the traditional definitions of teams — it creates whole communities that innovate together. And it’s also the part that is currently missing from the way we do environmental science.\nSo my work with Openscapes is harness the power of welcome to … welcome more environmental scientists into this feedback loop. This means being kind and empathetic when discussing open data science with research groups, and help them operate more like a team in an open data science context. With Openscapes, we started on the teamwork side but immediately framed it around open data science and then continued to loop around. Build more trust, discuss more tools. Discuss current norms in the research group, discuss available open tools and practices. Create a code of conduct, Create a GitHub organization. The first Openscapes cohort has had awesome acheivements and momentum, and I’m excited to revisit and improve upon the program to help science teams get into this feedback loop as effectively as possible!"

    "text": "R is the force that enables us to do better science in less time\nI like to talk about all of this in terms of metaphors with Star Wars, hence the title slide :).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Luke Skywalker after he crashed his plane in the swamp on Dagobah.\nHe cannot solve the the challenge in front of him with the skillsets he has, and it is super demoralizing. And if you imagine him attempting to use whatever pulleys and ropes he might have with him, you know it wouldn’t be pretty, it wouldn’t be reproducible, and it probably wouldn’t get him where he needs to be on time. But luckily what happens next is that he meets Yoda —\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Yoda has a skillset to solve Luke’s problem in a way Luke never imagined was possible. He uses the Force.\nAnd this is going to change Luke’s life, both in terms of skills and mindset. Luke can see what’s possible and he can learn these skills from Yoda. And he will be able to not only solve his current challenge, but it will broaden his whole mind to what is possible in the future and the scale of the challenges he will take on.\nBut Luke didn’t go on to defeat the Empire himself, he had a whole community.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this community is powerful because of the diversity of backgrounds and expertise, and although not everyone is a Jedi, everyone contributes in really critical ways. So to recap:\n\n\n\n\n\nR is the Force that enables us as scientists to do better science in less time.\nIt empowers us to get our own data out of the swamp. And it empowers us and build off of our confidence and experiences and broaden the scope of scientific challenges that we can tackle, which for environmental scientists, includes food security, disease transmission, and climate change.\n–\nOver the years folks have asked who is Yoda in this analogy. The answer is, it’s relative. To me, Yoda is many of the people at useR! and in the #rstats community; they are the developers of the R tools and packages I use. In this scenario, they are the Jedis and feel more like Rey. But when I mentor with Openscapes and lead trainings with RLadiesSB, Eco-Data-Science, NCEAS, and The Carpentries, folks see me as Yoda, and they feel like Rey. And I think that’s an important part of this; even if you don’t feel like THE Jedi or expert, you probably are to some people, and you can step up into that role and help welcome them to the power of the Force. And that can start immediately: you can champion R as the Force now.\nThis is a good place to end the highlights from my talk and answer a few questions that were submitted in Toulouse after my keynote."

    "title": "Keynote at the useR! conference",
    "section": "Q&A",
    "text": "Q&A\n\nDo we need to talk about “open data science” instead of just “open science”\nOne of the questions I was asked after the talk was about whether “open data science” is needed as a distinction from “open science”; isn’t it already a part of open science as a whole? I don’t think I answered that question completely in the moment (I was pretty fried) so I thought I’d try to articulate my response a bit here.\nTo me, “open data science” is more about bringing “open” to the topic of “data science” rather than distinguishing “data” in “open science”. I think the concepts of openness are really critical when we think about data science and coding. My coding experience began with proprietary software and sluggish sharing (for both technical and mindset reasons), so I think it’s important to be explicit and talk about openness and code together. Openness in data science can help daylight “black box” algorithms. And it can also facilitate innovation through reusing and remixing code that we can run on our own machines because the language is open source and we share it openly.\n\n\n\nWith every PhD student generation, do you feel that it becomes easier to convince them to engage in Open Science? Or is there recurring resistance?\nYes, I think it is getting easier. I think that the new (now?) generation of scientists are much more willing to engage in open science. They have grown up sharing (Instagram, Facebook, Google Docs), and they help bring the idea of sharing openly to the scientific community. And I’m excited to see this because there is great opportunity for open practices to not only accelerate and amplify collaboration and scientific discoveries, but, importantly, to be valued and rewarded within the academic system. We really need to favor openness and team science, because no one can do it all, and we need to break down the expectation that they should be able to.\n\n\n\nHow did u convince ur boss to have believe in something he didn’t have knowledge about?\nConvincing our boss that open data science was worth our time to learn required a combination of trust, demonstrating its value in ways that he cared about, and absolute necessity.\nIn terms of trust, he already gave us independence in our tasks, valued our judgment, and welcomed feedback. This had been established within the team for months to years, so it was a collaborative environment before we even began talking about open data science.\nWe were able to demonstrate value in ways that he cared about: we showed him that R and GitHub would save time. And we were clear that it would not be immediate; it might take us three days to do something in R that we could produce in Excel in a half a day — but it will take just a half-hour next week. And the week after that. We demonstrated how nimble we were to rerun analyses with small changes to parameters or subsets of data, and that these skills would be valuable not only for the current project but for projects to come. And visualizations helped a lot too, as well as interactive graphics and gifs (super great for demonstrating change over time, which ecologists think about a lot).\nThis argument was helped because of absolute necessity. We had deadlines approaching and we were spending time retracing our steps instead of taking the next steps forward. We needed a better way to work: it was not sustainable to have to waste so much time doing forensics in our emails and file systems to try to figure out what we had done and why in order to advance our analyses. For a dramatic analogy, it was like accepting that candles were not producing enough light anymore and that we needed to wire our house for electricity. It meant overcoming inertia and the time it takes for changing this infrastructure, but it means that we can be more efficient in the long run.\n\n\n\nHow can you keep the balance between sharing and open data and protecting the data while working in a private company?\nThe advice that comes to mind is to “be as open as possible, and as closed as necessary”. Folks have developed ways to summarize or anonymize sensitive data before sharing, and it is also possible to share code or methods, etc without sharing the data. I strongly believe that there are many ways to work openly even if you can’t share your data; you can share slides from talks, teaching materials from your courses, snippets of code or methods; you can also blog, you can publish in open access journals, you can engage on social media and in local communities. It’s an exciting time for open science.\nI also think that part of sharing and openness is being aware and engaged with what is possible on the software side so that your current, individual skillsets or experiences don’t limit your imagination.\nTo go back to the Star Wars analogy, when Luke was weighing his options of how to get his plane out of the Dagobah swamp, he never would have considered the Force unless he saw what Yoda was able to do. And that develops a mindset where even if you have not seen exactly everything that is possible, you start to expect that it is possible. Luke lifted up that rock? And R2? Well, then, he should be able to do an X-Wing. Twitter is a great tool to keep tabs on new ideas and projects so that you broaden your expectations of what’s possible (see the next question).\nOn the science side, I think sometimes our uneasiness about sharing is because we do not know what’s possible, and it seems like a lot of extra work. If your experience with sharing (smallish) data has been limited to written text in email with attachments, the idea of sharing broadly and keeping things up to date seems like a huge task. But if your whole workflow uses tools that streamline your day-to-day organization and analyses, then sharing requires much lower activation energy. And I think the mindset shift precedes expertise. When you not only see but have a touch of experience with how a GitHub account and a bit of Markdown gives you a whole new, update-able communication platform, it really does help spark a change in mindset. And while there is time involved in sharing information, the time-saving benefits and power in the near and long term are worth the investment (just like they are for Luke and Rey).\n\n\n\nHow to use Twitter effectively to improve our skills and share our experience?\nMy advice for Twitter is to start off small and deliberately. Use it to listen and learn, and then you can gradually build up the courage to like and retweet things. And remember that liking and retweeting is not only a way to engage with the community yourself, but it is also a way to welcome and amplify other people.\nIf you’re joining twitter to learn R, I suggest following @hadleywickham, @JennyBryan, @rOpenSci, @WeAreRLadies. Listen to what they say and who joins those conversations, and follow other people and organizations. You could also look at who they are following. Also, check out the #rstats hashtag. This is not something that you can follow (although you can have it as a column in software like TweetDeck), but you can search it and you’ll see that the people you follow use it to help tag conversations. You’ll find other useful tags as well, within your domain, as well as other R-related interests, e.g. #rspatial. When I read marine science papers, I see if the authors are on Twitter; I sometimes follow them, ask them questions, or just tell them I liked their work!\nIn Openscapes I talk through the following examples to show how I use Twitter to learn new things and keep tabs on (some of!) what’s going on in R. I miss a lot because I’m not on Twitter all the time. And that is OK. There is too much goodness to know it all, and I am by no stretch of the imagination on top of it all or experienced with everything folks are developing. But, I learn more than I would if I were never on Twitter. Also, you can always look back at past users and hashtags and get “news updates” as you please. The search feature is pretty good!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I saw this tweet by @Md_Harris, this was my internal monologue:\n\nCool visualization!\nI want to represent my data this way\nHe includes his code that I can look at to understand what he did, and I can run and remix\nThe package is from @sckottie — I know he is at rOpenSci, which is a really amazing software developer community for science\nrnoaa is a package making NOAA [US environmental] data more accessible! I didn’t know about this, it will be so useful for my colleagues\nI will retweet so my network can benefit as well\n\n\nAnother example, this tweet where @JennyBryan is asking for feedback on a super useful package for interfacing between R and excel: readxl.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy internal monologue:\n\nYay, readxl is awesome, and also getting better\nDo I have any spreadsheets to contribute?\nIn any case, I will retweet so others can contribute. And I’ll like it too because I appreciate this work\n\n\nThese are just a few ways to learn and build community on Twitter. And as you feel comfortable, you can start sharing your ideas or your links too. Live-tweeting is a really great way to engage as well, and bridge in-person conferences with online communities. And of course, in addition to engaging on Twitter, check whether there are local RLadies chapters or other R meetups, and join! Or perhaps start one?\n\n\n\nAs a marine scientist how do we get involved in Openscapes?\nGreat question :) :). And a great one to end on.\nThe most immediate thing to join the Openscapes effort and community is to visit the get involved page — there is a signup sheet and you can also follow us on Twitter. I also want to get in front of more marine science & environmental science audiences, to give department seminars and conference talks. It is kind of crazy to me that I’ve given a big talk like this one at useR! but not at any big marine/environmental conferences. Or maybe that’s not surprising since I’m focused on increasing the visibility and value of open data science within environmental science, since it’s not really a “mainstream” conversation yet, like it is in #rstats. In any case, if that is something you can help arrange, please get in touch!\nI am currently strategizing and fundraising to build out Openscapes into a full-time, long-term program operated at the US National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis at the University of California Santa Barbara, where I am based. I will be focused on this in the next nine months due to a generous gift from the Moore Foundation following my fellowship support from Mozilla. My goal is to increase the number of research groups Openscapes mentors each year with a small core team and vibrant community. I also want to see about extending/replicating/spinning off Openscapes to other communities (i.e. beyond environmental science). I plan to continue the online cohorts, scaling up as Mozilla Open Leaders has. Additionally, this winter I will lead my first in-person workshop for research groups, adapting the Champions lesson series (and hoping to find time to build that out more too!).\nBut I’m excited to hear your ideas! Please reach out; I’d love to hear from you.\n–\nThanks for reading, and thanks again to everyone at #useR2019!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome to Pathways to Open Science, a remote event series for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science! What you will read here includes numbers and facts we’ve reported to our gracious funders, but more than anything we provided an inclusive onramp for open science in an intentional way that will continue to inspire more equitable open science programming moving forward. The Pathways team is so excited to report that this series provided tangible skills that will accelerate the science of incredible Black researchers across the globe (we even had international participants!). While difficult to capture with numbers, the community, hope, and excitement within this space was invaluable. This program was a true labor of love for us as organizers who have often felt the burden of being one of few or the only Black researcher in the room. It is also a powerful testament to the powerful allyship of our organizers and funders in centering Black leadership in efforts to successfully serve our community as demonstrated here. It was an honor to create this space with our team and spearhead this effort, and we look forward to improving our approach to build even more community in the years to come.\nThe following is our final report to our funder Code for Science and Society’s Event Fund and CZI. We are so grateful for their support!\nIleana Fenwick ♥️\n\n\nPoint of Contact / Applicant Name: Ileana Fenwick, Julia Lowndes\n\n\nEvent Sponsor:\n\nOpenscapes\nBlack in Marine Science (BIMS, Partner)\nBlack Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science (BWEEMS, Partner)\nOpen Collective (Fiscal Sponsor)\n\nName of Event(s): Pathways to Open Science\nDate(s) of Event(s): January 26 - March 2, 2023\nEvent url: https://openscapes.github.io/pathways-to-open-science/\n\n\nNames of event organizers and their roles:\n\nIleana Fenwick, PhD Student, UNC Chapel Hill and Pathways Lead\nAlex Davis, Postdoctoral Fellow, The Diversity Project at UCLA, and Pathways co-organizer\nAneese Williams, Environmental Management Systems Coordinator for the City of West Palm Beach, FL and Pathways co-organizer\nJulie Lowndes Openscapes, Pathways support\nStefanie Butland Openscapes, Pathways support\n\n\n\nHow many participants did you have?\n\nJan 26: 80 attendees, 150 registered (capped registration)\nFeb 2: 22 attendees, 96 registered\nFeb 9: 27 attendees, 80 registered\nFeb 16: 8 attendees, 47 registered\nFeb 23: 17 attendees, 71 registered\nMar 2: : 8 attendees, 47 registered\n\nNotes: We led Community Calls with lessons and guest speakers (bold) in alternating weeks from Coworking, where folks could come work socially and ask questions.\nOur first Community Call in the series had over 80 participants! Subsequent Calls had lower attendance. This is expected, and we are celebrating impact not only in numbers, but in deep connections and stories. The impacts of Call 1 and subsequent sessions were different and we are assessing the success of the first and subsequent Calls and the Coworking sessions differently. In the first Call, a very large number of Black researchers were exposed to / introduced to Black leaders in the open data science world and to 80 people who were also interested. This was about welcoming new folks to open science. The impacts of subsequent sessions were more about developing real relationships, providing concrete guidance to specific questions folks brought, and leading to more true community among some of the people who attended multiple sessions.\nMany folks from coworking attended all six events, and the connections are big and long-lasting. For example, one participant Aliyah shared her experiences learning R and Python in a small Coworking conversation with Dr. Farina from Howard University, a Historically Black College and University. Dr. Farina learned from Aliyah’s experience and plans to incorporate into her courses for undergraduates. Further, Aliyah is participating in a GIS class in France this summer, and Dr. Farina will share that opportunity with her students as well. This is one example of why we celebrate these connections, because their impact moves beyond the current programming and will expose students who were not present to opportunities and resources that otherwise would not have been shared with their professors.\nWe are interested in measuring impact not only by big numbers, remembering that Ileana Fenwick is an “n of 1” who has had an outsized influence. Ileana participated in an Openscapes event in 2021 funded by CS&S Event Fund, and is a powerful example of empowering folks to build community. This also aligns with “slowing down to speed up”, which we see again and again through Openscapes. “Small numbers are important” - Dr. Yvette Pearson, UT Dallas TOPS Supporting DEI in Open Science panel.\n\n\nHow were attendees and speakers / presenters recruited?\nAs designed, Ileana Fenwick spent many hours building on her relationships in the Black marine science community. She met 1:1 with many HBCU faculty, as well as BIMS and BWEEMS leadership to partner with liaisons and social media strategy. Attendees learned about the event through their HBCU professors, through BIMS and BWEEMS newsletters, and on Twitter and Instagram with original graphics featuring welcoming open science tips and Black researchers.\nIleana has presented about what she learned during the engagement process and “examining the cracks” the day of the first Pathways event at the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Winter Meeting (blog post and recording) as well as for at the University of Toronto Mississauga Biology Seminar (slides) after the whole event series completed.\n\n\nWhat were the original goals of your event? Did these goals shift over time? How and why?\nOur goals stayed the same; we are very happy to have met our original goals. The goals were to convene a remote event series for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science. We aimed to welcome folks to open science (Community Call 1) and provide opportunities for them to meet each other, hear stories from Black leaders (Community Calls 1-3), and have hands-on opportunities for followup (Coworking sessions 1-3).\n\n\n\n\nWord cloud of sentiments shared by participants in response to “Describe how you feel about (starting) your open science journey!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning the power of yet. Fact: I don’t know how to do this yet\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide a brief description of the activities / schedule.\nThis 6-part remote event series runs on Thursdays, January 26 - March 2. Event format alternated weekly (all virtual):\n\n3 community calls: 1.5 hour calls with facilitated discussion, mini-lectures and community conversations with Black data scientists, data science leaders and students\n\nFull topics next paragraph\n\n3 coworking sessions: 1.5 hour calls structured for folks to bring their own work, practice skill building, screenshare, and ask questions.\n\nFebruary 2, 16, March 2 from 5:00 to 6:00 pm EST\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 26: What is open science anyway? What can it mean for you?\nLearn all about open science and data organization skills that will save you time and energy!\nSpeakers:\n\nAlex Davis, Postdoctoral Fellow, The Diversity Project at UCLA, and Pathways co-organizer\nIleana Fenwick, PhD Student, UNC Chapel Hill and Pathways Lead\nAneese Williams, Environmental Management Systems Coordinator for the City of West Palm Beach, FL and Pathways co-organizer\n\n\n\n\n\nZoom participants in our kickoff Community Call including co-organizers Ileana Fenwick, Alex Davis, And Aneese Williams\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 9: Building our skills for a better tomorrow\nHear from experts about building community and your data science toolkit for more efficient research!\nSpeakers:\n\nLaTreese Denson, Stock Assessment Analyst, NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center\nDe’Marcus Robinson, PhD Student, Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, UCLA\nJason Williams, Assistant Director, External Collaborations at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, DNALC; Education, Outreach, and Training lead for CyVerse\n\n\n\n\n\nZoom participants in our 2nd Community Call including speakers LaTreese Denson, De’Marcus Robinson, and Jason Williams\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 23: Data Science is for US\nJoin the conversation! Hear all about our journeys into data science and building community for innovation.\nSpeakers:\n\nSherAaron Hurt, Director of Workshops, The Carpentries\nTony Orr, Research Scientist, NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center\nDawn Wright, Chief Scientist, Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI)\n\n\n\n\n\nZoom participants in our 3rd Community Call including speakers SherAaron Hurt, Tony Orr, and Dawn Wright\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat challenges did you face and how might you overcome them if you were to hold the event again?\nOur time-budgeting was correct, but the way we distributed it was not. Ileana had budgeted time/month to focus on Pathways, and it was much more front-loaded with all the engagement with HBCU 1:1s, meeting with BIMS and BWEEMS leadership to design the strategy and write about the liaison opportunities for their membership newsletter, and then meeting with BIMS and BWEEMS liaisons, graphics designer, and social media liaisons individually to establish relationships before we began meeting regularly as a team. Building these relationships was part of the original proposal and event design, and were key to the event series’ success. In the future we’ll have to think about how to make that more manageable.\n\n\nWhat were the event’s biggest successes?\nOne of the most frequent comments from participants and speakers has been how wonderful it is to see so many Black faces together. We heard real career stories including successes, struggles, and advice for how to learn. There were brave questions by participants and honest, reflective responses about how to show up and celebrate being Black in the predominantly white fields of marine and environmental science and open data science and at predominantly white institutions (PWI’s). We also learned and shared a lot of open source tools, open educational resources that we linked from our website following each event: https://openscapes.github.io/pathways-to-open-science/.\n\n\nWhat steps have you taken to build or sustain the community after the event?\nChallenge: aftercare of the community. We have a private Slack channel for participants inside our larger Slack for participants of all Openscapes programs. People were keen to join. There are currently 21 members including Stefanie Butland and Julie Lowndes (as of April 25, 2023). However, it is quiet there. Ileana has been posting a Thursday Tip each week since the event series ended, but without much engagement in this channel or in the broader Openscapes Slack. It will take development of an intentional approach to foster communication and community building here.\nAlex Davis and Aneese Williams have joined the broader Openscapes Mentors community, where Ileana, Stefanie and Julie have already been active. From January-May through our bi-weekly meetings we are learning coaching skills with Tara Robertson, a DEI consultant and leadership coach who has worked with Openscapes since 2021, initially through a CS&S Event Fund grant (for the Openscapes event series where Ileana first participated!). We are learning valuable coaching skills - how to ask open-ended questions, how to listen - that make us better equipped as mentors, teachers, and leaders. When listening as a coach, we’re trying to help the other person define their problem and find their solution, outside of our expertise. This is different from mentoring, when we do have an answer within our expertise. Developing these coach listening skills, what questions to ask, and when to use mentoring vs coaching skills, is the focus of our sessions; we are practicing coaching skills together to tackle common challenges and skill-build together.\nOur mentor-coach sessions include the Pathways Mentors and are also cross-government, and include Openscapes mentors working within and across their own institutions.\n\nNMFS Mentors\nNASA Openscapes Mentors\nCalifornia WaterBoards/Cal EPA mentors\nPathways to Open Science mentors\nEPA mentors\n\n\n\nDo you plan to hold this event again? Why/why not?\nWe do; Openscapes is committed to supporting this event annually. We have included this into a 3-year grant proposal with NOAA Fisheries and plan for this is to be a model we can grow, both in terms of longer term funded proposals and through supporting Mentors who can support these events in other places.\n\n\nAre there any additional ways in which CS&S could have supported you in planning this event?\nPerhaps shared resources like Zoom? We capped registration at 150 folks for the first session, and had to buy a Zoom large-event 1-month upgrade. We hadn’t budgeted for this and asked if the Event Fund could help; Openscapes ultimately paid for this and luckily had the budget to do so, but in the recent past this would not have been possible. \n\n\nWhat was your process for developing and implementing your code of conduct/guidelines for community participation?\nThe Openscapes Code of Conduct is heavily drawn from rOpenSci and Mozilla, who we greatly appreciate for their leadership in this area (see Mozilla’s inclusion repo). Additional resources influencing this document include RStudio, Open Post Academics, and the groups described in Open Software Means Kinder Science. Please also see the value and ethics statements from Ben Marwick’s lab as well as other inspiring examples from EpiEllie’s twitter thread and the Coop at Fred Hutch.\n\n\nLink to the final code of conduct/guidelines for community participation used for your event:\nhttps://www.openscapes.org/code-of-conduct/\n\n\nWhat products (e.g. recordings, papers, software) were created as a result of the event? Please provide links.\nOur website served first as a place to advertise the event and for folks to register; we then continued adding information to it as we developed the Pathways program and added all resource links from the resources page. \nhttps://openscapes.github.io/pathways-to-open-science/resources includes:\n\nVideo recordings\nLive note docs\nResources mentioned in the calls\n\n\n\nPlease describe any approved changes to your budget.\nFunds declined as honoraria were allocated to lead organizers Fenwick, Williams, and Davis\n\n\nDid you administer the impact survey to your participants?\nYes, along with a short survey specific to our audience.\n\n\nAny other comments/feedback?\nThank you to the Event Fund and CZI for making this possible! This was really joyful to design and lead. We’ve all learned a lot along the way – whether that is engagement and “examining the cracks”, to open facilitation strategies, using Slack and Google Drive, to the acronym PWI (predominantly white institutions). Further, the impact we’ve seen is really profound. Here are a few pieces of shared joy:\n\n\nTestimonials\nFeb 1 - after event 1 of 6\n\n\n“Another impact from Pathways!! Our Howard professor reached out saying she has a freshman biology student who is now interested in fisheries and asked about internships for this summer”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of a participant’s unsolicited feedback\n\n\n\nFeb 3 - A message about Pathways coworking\n\n\n“I desperately need to just sit down and tackle this daunting task so it was good accountability plus it gave me some possible alternatives that might be quicker!” I am so happy that coworking created space for this!!!“\n\n\n\n\nParting thought\nOur planning team meetings were very joyful! We had regular coworking meetings to get things done together. Here is a peek at our ongoing meeting doc:\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of our planning team’s coworking Google Doc"

My work is very collaborative and I have systems and software I use with different collaborators — for example if there are at least 5 people working on a project, we will use GitHub. But if smaller amount of people we usually use Dropbox. I’ve spent the past five months thinking about what systems we should set up in the Froehlich Lab and learning how other Champions labs are set up in the digital space and getting ideas for what works and what to look into further. I’ve also learned about some R packages I need to be using and excited to pass it forward to my colleagues:\n\n\n  \n\n\nThis year I’ve also been designing my laboratory space, and done so to enable collaboration and open discussion in the physical realm.

    "text": "Openscapes summit reflections — becoming champions\nThis article is cross-posted on medium.com\nIn March 2019 I witnessed environmental scientists become champions for open data science when we brought the inaugural cohort of Openscapes Champions together for a summit in Santa Barbara, California. The summit was supported by Mozilla and hosted at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) with the purpose of building relationships, sharing lessons learned, and igniting collaborations. This is the first of several blogs, as an overview of the event and its outcomes.\n\nThe Openscapes Summit exceeded my (very high!) expectations. It occurred half-way through the Champions program, after three months of one-on-one mentorship and cohort lessons (learn more about the Champions program and meet the Champions). Participants gathered knowing that open data science is powerful and knowing that it is important to me, but from my perspective they left feeling its importance for themselves, and feeling a part of a greater movement. Or, as my friend summarized: “They became Champions”.\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapes Summit, 2019, etching on AirBnB pillows. Left to right: Sean Kross, Adrian Stier, Nina Therkildsen, Julie Lowndes, Malin Pinsky, Halley Froehlich, Allison Horst.\n\n\n\nWe had just a short one-and-a-half days together, but we accomplished so much. In addition to bringing environmental scientists together to meet for the first time, we also included a software developer and a leader in the open science movement, which combined the communities Openscapes aims to bridge and which energized us all with new perspectives and concrete checklists. We discussed issues big and small (from how to get university support for open data science to how to use Google Docs’ document outline view), identified research collaborations, brainstormed a manuscript, skill-shared (data storage & backup tips, project management software, and more), and ended the whole summit with exchanging appreciation via sticky notes (something I learned from Mozilla) and a hike together in the Los Padres National Forest.\n\n\n\n\nSetting off for a closing hike (computers stayed behind).\n\n\n\nWe had a good balance of structured time (to share progress, learn together, and plan a manuscript) with unstructured time so Champions could build from our Openscapes discussions, talk science, and more generally get to know each other. We started off by sharing our Pathways, which is a way to think deliberately about (and track) reproducibility, collaboration, and communication within the lab by listing the tools and approaches used now and to help prioritize the next steps.\n\n\n\n\nPathway tool to help identify and improve practices.\n\n\n\nWe discussed the changing softwarescape and how it impacts science. We are not experts, but how do we set up shared practices for our labs? We kept circling back to the idea that it does not have to be perfect, but it can be better. We can create a space where we can talk about data, a space and culture of learning because we know things will change. At dinner, we continued these conversations and also discussed a few prepared conversation topics based on the conversations I had had with the Champions individually throughout the last few months that could benefit everyone (“ask Chelsea about hackathons”, “ask Nina about teaching straight from R for Data Science”).\n\n\n\n\nSummit brainstorm at NCEAS.\n\n\n\nDr. Christie Bahlai joined as us as a special guest for Friday morning to discuss open lab culture and championing open data science practices in ecology. Dr. Bahlai is an applied quantitative ecologist, professor at Kent State University, and Mozilla Fellow. We discussed strategies for creating and fostering a good culture in the lab, and learned about her lab’s procedures for onboarding (Reproducible Quantitative Methods course) and offboarding (Project completion checklist). We talked about how important it is for lab culture to deliberately think about what creates a digital citizens in terms of collaboration, data management, and working openly, and how teaching this is critical in addition to teaching statistics.\nTalking with Christie was so valuable and refreshing. She shared the realities of leading a research laboratory and practicing open science, which is both empowering and challenging. Through her lab’s website she sets clear expectations for the tenor and values of the lab, and for being available for statistical/data/coding consultation but also protective of her time. It was really inspiring to see how the open movement and the Mozilla fellowship has influenced her scientific work and how she continues passing it forward as a leader across communities.\n\n\n\n\nDiscussing open science and lab culture with Christie Bahlai and Chelsea Wood.\n\n\n\nSean Kross also joined us in person for the whole Summit – he is a PhD student at UC San Diego studying Human-Computer Interaction. Sean’s research interests include understanding how data scientific workflows effect research outcomes, creating tools for data science instructors, and making online education more humane and interactive. He was interested in hearing our conversations and how we are are thinking about data science in our labs. One incredibly cool moment was when Sean said “Hey Adrian, you know how you were hoping there was a way to sort through activity by user and repo within a GitHub organization? I coded that up this morning — see what you think”. We’ll have a followup about that, stay tuned.\nHaving Sean participate was so valuable in many ways. He is a big part of the open source software (#rstats) community that has empowered me with open data science and welcomed me as an ally to this movement of innovation and sharing. Something I am trying to do with Openscapes is to bring that culture of welcome and empowerment to the environmental science community, and I think the Champions learned more about what that can look like through discussions with Sean. We also discussed the awesomeness of hex stickers, which are a fun thing to put on our computers and water bottles to identify each other as part of the open software and open science communities.\n\n\n\n\nThe joy of putting the first hex sticker on your computer. Honored it was an Openscapes one :).\n\n\n\nOverall, I was amazed how engaged, energized, and open everyone was throughout our time together. It is a lot to ask for two full days of early career scientists’ time, particularly when they are already giving Openscapes four hours a month, and additionally working on Openscapes concepts with their labs. On Friday when we filmed individual interviews, there were over two hours of completely unstructured time where I had hoped Champions would continue Openscapes discussions, strike up research conversations, but could also catch up on work or email if need be. But during that time no one had their computers out; they were engaged in deep conversations, sharing their experiences as scientists, as faculty, as teachers. They were connecting deeply as people dedicated to science and improving the scientific culture around them. And that is the best part about the whole thing.\nThey truly are Champions.\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapes selfie at NCEAS."

    "section": "Main advice for remote workshops & meetings",
    "text": "Main advice for remote workshops & meetings\nThe point of remote workshops and meetings is for people to be actively engaged — this is the main difference between a workshop and more passive webinars. You can do this with a mix of technology & social setup.\n\nZoom video conference software (or similar), with each person on their own laptop with video on — even if you are in person with other people.\nGoogle docs (or similar) with live note-taking so that there are non-verbal channels to participate.\nCode of Conduct (Community Participation Guidelines) to set the tone of the meeting and have everyone feel welcome.\n\nImportantly, you must include time (it can be <3 minutes) at the very beginning of your call to show people how to use Google Docs and Zoom. Few people (or no one?) was ever formally taught how to use this software, which means there are varying degrees of familiarity and comfort, and you cannot assume everyone is on the same page. Take the time to get them there.\nI’ll go through each of these a bit more deeply — but also check out Mozilla Open Leaders’ Abby Cabunoc Mayes’ thread about online meeting tips.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nZoom video conferencing for visual engagement\nZoom video conferencing software is free to download, and you can schedule meetings ahead of times that you can include in emails or Calendar Invites. Having all participants join the call from their own computer is a way to have everyone engaged, especially when they have their videos on. (This is obviously not always possible, and it is preferable to have someone join without video than not join at all, but videos on is a good norm to set). A few other features of Zoom that makes it great for remote workshops:\n\nYou can toggle between Gallery View to see everyone’s faces rather than Presenter View.\nRecording is straight-forward and will include screencasts if you are sharing screens, and has a pretty compressed file that is good to share afterwards\nThe breakout room feature is super useful if you want to enable smaller conversations. You can set up breakout rooms ahead of time or let it randomly break people into groups, and then you can manually move people around if need be.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of Zoom Gallery View with the 2019 Openscapes Champions.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Docs for hands-on participation\nCreating an agenda ahead of time (and including it in your emails and Calendar Invites — remembering to give all participants editing privileges) is the second big piece for remote workshops. Depending on the event it doesn’t have to be a super involved agenda, but having a place where participants can be hands-on during the workshop is really important for their engagement.\n\nAs host/organizer, use this Google Doc agenda to your advantage: write down notes for what you want to say. There doesn’t need to be a big reveal, and if participants can read and hear it reinforces your message. I often highlight the sections I’m talking about to help draw focus.\nStart the document with a role call for folks to do as they join the call; it also sets the norm that everyone is invited to and expected to write in the agenda (see Abby’s thread)\nInclude time at the very beginning to show people how to use Google Docs and Zoom to make sure everyone is comfortable and empowered.\n\nInclude links to any slides or documents within the Agenda so that everything you discuss in the agenda are available to others. This leads to the next point:\nHave participants advance slides on their own. This not only reduces bandwidth problems that can come with screensharing, but it gives participants an additional way to engage hands-on; they need to advance the slides themselves. Doing this does mean giving slides access to everyone, and Google Slides and R (beamer, isoslides, xaringan) are great for this.\nEncourage note-taking and side conversations. Adding +1’s to show support for different ideas is a great way for folks to engage (as are emojis, pictures, and gifs)\n\nYou are welcome to use/remix these agendas from Openscapes (also linked from the Lesson Series).\n\n\n \n\nExample of Google Docs Agenda, including role call and quick intro to collaborative notes.\n\n\n\nAlso, if you are often meeting with the same person, have a single document where you meet, and add that link to Calendar Invites. Add the most recent meetings by date to the top of the file, so there is less scrolling to engage in the document each time.\n\n\nCode of Conduct to set a welcoming tone for all participants\nCodes of Conduct and Community Participation Guidelines help set the tone of the workshop and make people feel welcome. While CoCs are becoming more normal in open communities (including at large tech conferences like rstudio::conf), they are still not the norm in many settings. So remote workshops are a great place to lead by example and set the conditions of participation.\nOpenscapes borrows from Mozilla’s Community Participation Guidelines, and we cover the following points outloud at the beginning of a meeting (these are bulleted in the Google Docs agenda);\n\nBe respectful and value each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints.\nBe direct but professional; we cannot withhold hard truths.\nBe inclusive and help new perspectives be heard.\nBe open to learning from others.\nLead by example and match your actions with your words.\nIf you have issues, please direct them to:\n\nJulie - lowndes@nceas.ucsb.edu"

    "text": "Openscapes setup\nThis is an excerpt from a previous post Introducing the Champions program that describes how we use these together for remote calls twice a month for five months:\n\n\n“Openscapes Champions is a five-month mentorship program that is led remotely. Each month, there is individual mentorship for each Champion, and two”Cohort Calls” where we convene all Champions together, along with their lab members. Throughout, all participants learn about open practices and data science; strategize how to engage; meet other labs; set, review, and meet goals; and stay accountable. For each 1.5-hour Cohort Call, I teach for a maximum of 40 minutes, so that we spend most time discussing these topics in the context of their labs.”\n\n\n\n\n“So how do you lead a remote program like this? You model it after Mozilla Open Leaders, which has developed a great program that they have repeatedly tested and improved over seven rounds. It takes intense coordination, deliberate focus on creating a positive and inclusive culture, design to make calls engaging and interactive, Zoom, and Google Docs. (I think this is really cool how the intentions of the program are realized with the software tools available — you will see this as a theme throughout). I will focus on the software here, and have a whole separate upcoming post on culture.”\n\n\n\n\n“Zoom and Google Docs”\n\n\n\n\n“Participants all join Cohort Calls through Zoom, a video conferencing software that we use to interact in real time and also record the whole call as an archived resource for participants. In addition to accommodating large groups for discussions, it also has a great breakout room feature. Breakout rooms allows all participants to not only listen to lessons and discuss as a full group, but also lets them break into small groups to discuss topics. Following breakout groups, participants rejoin and summarize to the group both verbally and in writing, using Google Docs.”\n\n\n::: {.blockquote-blue} > “Each call has an agenda written as a Google Doc to enable real-time participation. During the call, all participants have the agenda open, and follow along, writing their thoughts in specific places and participating in active shared note-taking. This is an example pre-call agenda. Following the real-time writing and engagement during the Cohort Call, the agenda serves as a record of the discussions had that participants can revisit and anyone who missed can review.”\nThere are definitely ways to improve and scale to accommodate people of different abilities and obligations, but this is where we are with Openscapes at the moment. I hope this is helpful and there will be future posts as we learn and iterate moving forward!"

It takes a lot of time to collaborate, to teach, to learn, to try new things and change tracks, to tinker around with new tooling and workflows, to make and grow from mistakes. Being supported to slow down and invest this time is critical for the culture change we need as part of the broader open movement. And balancing this with all All The Things on our plates and with the ongoing pandemic and global uncertainty is a perpetual challenge. Identifying and supporting the need for time is a big part of our work."

    "text": "This illustrated series was a collaboration between Julie and Allison, who like to talk endlessly about data, code, teaching, open science, and art. We’ve been collaborating since the beginnings of Openscapes: Allison created all artwork for the Openscapes website and slides and was part of the inaugural Champions cohort. Here, we wanted these illustrations to tell a story about why tidy data is so powerful for efficiency, repeatability, and collaboration, but also stand alone to be most flexible for teaching.\nPlease reuse & remix with your own communities, and enjoy:\n\nDownload from https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations\nReuse/remix from this slide deck\nView/share this twitter thread\n\n\n\nWhen we talk about organizing data to help us work in an efficient, reproducible, and collaborative way, we are talking about TIDY DATA. We mean deliberately thinking about the shape and structure of data – something that might not seem super exciting but is truly game-changing.\nSo let’s talk about what tidy data is and why it is so empowering for your analytical life.\n\nWhat is tidy data?\nTidy data is a way to describe data that’s organized with a particular structure – a rectangular structure, where each variable has its own column, and each observation has its own row (Wickham 2014).\n\n\n\n\nThis standard structure of tidy data led Hadley Wickham to describe it the way Leo Tolstoy describes families. Leo says “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way”. Similarly, Hadley says “tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy data for more efficient data science\nTidy data allows you to be more efficient by using existing tools deliberately built to do the things you need to do, from subsetting portions of your data to plotting maps of your study area. Using existing tools saves you from building from scratch each time you work with a new dataset (which can be time-consuming and demoralizing). And luckily, there are a lot of tools specifically built to wrangle untidy data into tidy data (for example, in the tidyr package). By being more equipped to wrangle your data into a tidy format, you can get to your analyses faster to start answering the questions you’re asking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy data for easier collaboration\nTidy data makes it easier to collaborate because our friends can use the same tools in a familiar way. Whether thinking about collaborators as current teammates, your future self, or future teammates, organizing and sharing data in a consistent and predictable way means less adjustment, time, and effort for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy data for reproducibility and reuse\nTidy data also makes it easier to reproduce analyses because they are easier to understand, update, and reuse. By using tools together that all expect tidy data as inputs, you can build and iterate really powerful workflows. And, when you have additional data entries, it’s no problem to re-run your code!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy data for the win!\nOnce you are empowered with tools to work with tidy data generally, it opens up a whole new world of datasets that feel more approachable because you can work using familiar tools. This transferrable confidence and ability to collaborate might be the best thing about tidy data.\n\n\n\n\nSo for more efficient, reproducible, and collaborative analyses, make friends with tidy data!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about tidy data:\nWickham, H (2014).

    "text": "Our 2nd Openscapes Community Call featured our chat with Tara Robertson, a diversity, equity, and inclusion consultant working with us to improve practices in Openscapes. The recording is on Openscapes YouTube (efficiency tip reminder: in YouTube, “L” will advance by 10 seconds, “J” will go back by 10 seconds 😀)\nThis call was meant as a way to recap a bit of our work with Tara over the last three months and share some of what we’ve learned. Here is an attempt to distill our conversation:\n\nStart where you are and then think of ways to be more inclusive. We added transcription to our Zoom events and a unit on psychological safety in the Openscapes Champions Program. We unpacked some unseen things we had around privilege in Open science and how we began to design for our values. Tara shared about Dr. Dori Tunstall’s work on respectful design.\nWe shared how we worked together as a team. Tara, Erin and Julie formed an informal book club and many of us realized on the Community Call we are reading the book, Braiding Sweetgrass by Dr. Robin Wall Kimmerer and we highly recommend it. We also love All We Can Save, a collection of essays by women on the climate crisis edited by Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson and Dr. Katharine K. Wilkinson.\nWe learned and created strategies for handling discrimination from resources and pointers and conversations with Tara. TL;DR - Slow down and take a breath. If something happens a strategy can be to say “something just happened here, let’s talk about it”\n\nJulie referenced the course we took on territorial land acknowledgements by Ta7talíya Nahanee, from the Squamish nation. Ta7talíya is offering this workshop again on June 21st, National Indigenous Peoples Day\nErin went to Hollaback Bystander training and shared some of the research that shows that having a plan for how you will act and react to racial injustice makes it more likely you will follow-through in the moment.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe, collectively, with all of you, want to transform how we do science and are practicing kinder science. During the call we realized that Tara had mentored us the way that we mentor Champions teams. With that insight, Julie and I are going to work on creating a pathway document for our DEI work, and continue to be an active part of the community.\nAs a way to carry kindness forward, we’re requesting that you take action and share on Twitter What’s something you learned or something you do in your work to #PracticeKindness?\nWe are grateful to Code for Science and Society for supporting this work and all of you who attended live or watch the recording. We’d love to connect with you all, and don’t forget to follow Tara on Twitter!\nWorking toward kinder science!\nErin, Julie, and Tara"

Openscapes is excited to partner with Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) in the inaugural FASEB DataWorks! Initiative.\nOver the last year, FASEB has been working with its community—researchers, policymakers, librarians, society leaders, and research administrators—to understand whether and how FASEB can support data management and sharing. FASEB DataWorks! is an intentionally open and collaborative approach to promoting culture change in the biological and biomedical sciences through conversation spaces, training, peer support, and prizes. Our goal is to transform the way research is performed and recognized. That is where our partnership with FASEB comes in.\nWe are collaborating in these two specific ways:\n\nWe are sharing the Openscapes Mindset at the first DataWorks! Salon this Thursday, October 7, 1pm ET. The Salon will be an interactive event introducing the DataWorks! Initiative to the broader FASEB community. We are looking forward to sharing what Open science means to us, imagine what being open means for future us (your future self, research group, and beyond), and how you might move forward toward that future. We know there isn’t a single pathway toward Open science and are looking forward to facilitating a discussion of these pathways to work more openly and collaboratively and will share resources to help attendees continue this journey beyond our 90 minute session. Register here.\nOpenscapes Champions FASEB Cohort - We will be supporting a 2.5 month, Openscapes Champions cohort sponsored by FASEB to develop teams of leaders wanting to transform their work practices to better data management and more reusable and reproducible workflows. This cohort is part of the larger DataWorks! Initiative to cultivate DataWorks! Fellows. More information and nominations for participation will be coming soon.\n\nWe think the best part of our job is getting to know awesome researchers doing amazing science. With this partnership, we are excited to grow the experimental biologist in our community and understand what are the common parts of the Open science pathway and what is unique. Please share this opportunity with those you know and let us know of any existing efforts that would be aligned with FASEB’s effort too."

    "title": "[Sea]side Chats for data workflows",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Seaside Chats. Bluffside Chats. Fishbowl Chats. Bayside Chats. This is where we discuss data workflows in the lab.\nRunning list of Champions teams’ Seaside Chats\n\nOne of the long-term goals of Openscapes is to change the culture about how we work with data — and that requires normalizing even talking about data. We need to be able to have meaningful conversations about data and data workflows: the strategies, the struggles, the successes.\nIn our Champions Cohort Calls, we aim to create a space where we can safely present ideas, learn from each other, and discuss together — and then seed these ideas in our labs, and ultimately our departments, universities, and beyond. This requires deliberately setting a friendly and constructive tone in these gatherings, and leading by example (see blog about RStudio Conference culture).\nTo put this to immediate practice, the main assignment for the Openscapes Champions program is for labs to have weekly meetings to deliberately discuss data workflows, develop overlapping skillsets, create shared systems for their labs, and cultivate an open culture in the lab. These meetings are called “[Sea]side Chats”.\nThe idea and name for Seaside Chats came from the Ocean Health Index team, circa 2015. Although we already had weekly lab meetings with our PI (principal investigator) to talk about science, we additionally needed a time to talk about how we were going to do the science. We needed a place to talk about, develop, and share ideas and data workflows, and also realized it would be super helpful for onboarding new lab members. Our PI didn’t need to come talk operations with us — we all know PIs do not need more meetings — but we had agency to start them, and he valued and encouraged them. They would be standing events on our calendar. Yes, these were going to be meetings, but they were going to be informal and lighthearted, so they would be “chats” rather than “meetings”. Like President Roosevelt’s Fireside Chats. But we are not by the fire, but we are by the sea. So they would be Seaside Chats.\nNow, the Openscapes labs have started Bluffside Chats at UC Santa Barbara, Fishbowl Chats at Rutgers, and Bayside Chats at University of Washington. They are a dedicated time created to not only discuss and strengthen data workflows, but also to strengthen lab culture. And what what is super cool is that seeding open culture is actually happening! This was captured in Michelle Stuart’s blog about the Pinsky Lab:\n\n\n“This open communication has leaked into the general discussion going on in our open work space. Lab members seem more comfortable with asking teammates for help, and it is exciting to see all of us getting on the same page with our data science.”\n\n\n\n\nSo what goes on in these Seaside chats? They are discussions that start with a specific topic that a rotating lead person has prepared. For the Ocean Health Index, we try to set next week’s topic at the current week’s Seaside Chat, although in reality sometimes we set it just the day before. Topics most often start with the current state of things for individuals in the lab, and end with how to streamline workflows as a lab and learn from each other. They can start off as discussions and end as more “hackathons” where we actually set up folder structure or servers and practice with each other.\nExamples include:\n\nwhere do we all keep our data? Here’s how our server works\nhow we all share code with our PI, and each other?\nlet’s discuss this interview with Jenny Bryan\nlet’s skill-share lab-specific techniques (genomics packages, etc)\nI have some code on X technique/stats/model I’d love to walk through\nI’m making a figure and would love feedback\nlet’s add short README files accompanying folders of data so we know what the heck things are\nlet’s watch this webinar about time travel with RStudio & GitHub\ncan you show us how to set up the Zotero citation software with RMarkdown\nfilepath woes: use .Rprojects\nfilepath woes 2: use the new here package in R!\nlet’s plan a lab “hackathon” to move these .xls to .csv files we store on GitHub\n\nThere are endless topics and no single place to start. Again, from Michelle’s blog:\n\n\n“We began by explaining the difference between git and GitHub and then had a 20 minute group discussion about what we should be putting on GitHub and how we wanted to use it as a group tool. We spent the rest of the hour in breakout groups addressing different obstacles people faced as beginner GitHub users. One group was creating accounts, one group was connecting to the pinskylab organization, and another was connecting RStudio to GitHub. It was great to see people migrating from group to group as issues were solved. By the end of our time together, it seemed like everyone had a good handle on using GitHub to share work with the rest of the team.”\n\n\nSimilarly, in Bayside Chats, the Wood Lab has met to discuss reproducible research, have a git/GitHub+RStudio tutorial, and chat about how to integrate the lab Google Drive with people’s (new) GitHub repos. The Wood Lab’s Danielle Claar described this process:\n\n\n“[In Bayside Chats], we are thinking about how to build redundancy in our lab for knowledge about reproducible research tools.”\n\n\nIn Bluffside Chats at UCSB, Allison Horst and Jessica Couture did a self-audit of how they were organizing and sharing materials for the courses they teach. They realized they could streamline where things lived to increase efficiency with working with each other, but also so that students would have one go-to place to find everything they need. Leaving the first Bluffside Chat with a solid plan, they have been putting this plan into practice in subsequent weeks.\n\n\n\nBuilding from discussions in Fishbowl Chats, the Pinsky Lab Cookbook is an online resource with “recipes” for working in the lab together. They include topics like adding undergraduates to the lab GitHub organization, how to install an older version of an R package, and how to set up video conferencing. Instead of teaching these things individually in person or through email, the Cookbook is a living document that all lab members know of and use as a resource, and they can update with more tips and workflows as needed. The idea was inspired by the BBC Visual and Data Journalism Cookbook for R Graphics; all teams need shared resources and practices to work together!\n\n\n\nThinking about what makes successful Seaside Chats, I came up with the following:\n\nThey should be fun and empowering. They are not meant to just add another meeting to your life, but to learn and share ways that will make everyone’s data experiences way more awesome. Mix up the topics and lead person so that there is a diversity of discussions and styles, but it’s up to everyone to come engaged and interested to learn together.\nHave Chats scheduled on the calendar as standing meetings. They can be canceled/reshuffled if needed, but having them as a weekly opportunity to discuss data questions is important not only to discuss data together, but to bond as a lab.\nHave a topic set in advance. There should be a purpose when you start the meeting, even if someone is prepared only to show something that takes 10 minutes: that will be an important 10 minutes and it will spark conversations beyond. The lead person could have been chosen: “hey could you show us that new package you’re using?” or self-nominated: “I’ve just figured out how to make this plot interactive, let me show you”.\nLeverage technology as needed: sometimes we use a monitor/projector, or even use Zoom video conferencing software (even if we’re all sitting together) so we can screenshare on personal laptops so that everyone can see what is being demonstrated. It can be useful to take group notes in a Google Doc — see next.\nKeep a list of the topics you’ve discussed. Not only does this show accomplishment of what you’ve covered, it can be useful to revisit if you’re onboarding new lab members; where were those notes with links to that cool package we learned?\n\nBut definitely always keep the first point in mind: these should be fun and empowering for individuals and the lab as a whole. Seaside, Bluffside, Fishbowl, and Bayside Chats, I can’t wait for more to come. There is so much awesome stuff to learn: let’s talk about it together.\n\n\nPhoto by Elliot Lowndes"

    "text": "Welcome to Openscapes’ sixth newsletter! If you’re interested in seeing these infrequent updates in your inbox, please sign up here (linked from our get involved page).\n\nHello! As we continue into 2023, we at Openscapes continue to come back to the core of what we do: we engage, empower, and amplify. Whether it is with tech like Quarto and JupyterHubs or communities like R-Ladies, Ladies of Landsat, Black in Marine Science, and NASA Earthdata, it’s about welcoming folks to better ways of working and open science.\nIn 2023, we’re committed to being braver in connecting the impact of our work to the environment and the climate movement; to culture and mindset change for individuals, for teams, and for institutions; and as always, to kinder science.\nIn the last year, what emerged was a clear sense of movement building towards better science for future us. The Openscapes community grew as Champions and Mentors prioritized time for learning, sharing, teaching with each other, and also advocated for themselves and their colleagues to have time to do so.\n\nNASA Openscapes Mentors continued co-creating and reusing teaching resources to support colleagues and researchers using NASA Earthdata to migrate workflows to the Cloud. Mentors also taught workshops, gave talks, participated and created in public forums, and built software and conceptual infrastructure to support users and practice open science, and are also investing their knowledge and lessons back into the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook. Co-lead Erin Robinson led a publication now under review about The Openscapes Flywheel: A framework for managers to facilitate and scale inclusive Open science practices (preprint).\nNOAA Fisheries Mentors supported their colleagues through six Champions Cohorts. Read about the experiences and impacts of Fall 2022 Openscapes training nationwide, with additional posts from NOAA Fisheries Alaska, and Southwest, Summer Southeast, and Winter Alaska Fisheries Science Centers. Additional resources include the NMFS Openscapes site and NMFS Open Science Resource Book.\nCalifornia Water Boards / CalEPA Mentors forked the Champions program and co-led the first Cohort for the California Water Boards (blog post) and fully documented it in a Quarto book, Openscapes at the Water Boards.\n240 Champions participated in Openscapes this year; their work and energy has been awesome! It’s so wonderful to see teams of Champions come back to guest-teach their peers and share their ongoing journeys toward more open, kinder science. See their stories above with NASA, NOAA Fisheries, and CalEPA.\nIleana Fenwick and Stefanie Butland joined the Openscapes team (tweet)! They both do incredibly valuable work and we are so grateful to work together.\nWe hosted 3 Community Calls: A Qualitative Data Analysis Chat with Dr. Beth Duckles; Hello Quarto! A Quarto Chat with NASA Openscapes, co-hosted with R-Ladies Santa Barbara; Reimagining open science as part of the climate movement, a chat with Dr. Monica Granados (summary posts of Community Calls).\nJulie gave a co-keynote at rstudio::conf(2022) with Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, titled Hello Quarto: share, collaborate, teach, reimagine. This was the official launch of Quarto (blog post) and it was such an honor to share about the Openscapes community on this big stage!\nOne of the things we hear often from researchers is that they feel like they can’t take vacation - too much rests solely on their shoulders, solely on their laptops. In the shared-joy and sustainability-through-open-science departments, Julie wrote about how our open science process made it possible for her to unplug for a 2-week vacation (blog post).\nShoutout to all the Champions and Mentors and community who have shared their successes - big and small - with us. You keep us energized!\n\nThis year, we’re continuing our work with NASA, NOAA, and the California Water Boards and have started new relationships and programs. We’re excited to continue to grow the Open Science movement as part of the Year of Open Science (Biden Harris administration announcement).\n\nAlready we’ve launched Pathways to Open Science for Black environmental & marine researchers, led by Ileana Fenwick in partnership with Black in Marine Science (BIMS) and Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science (BWEEMS). 80 people attended the first session(!) and we are committing to offer this annually.\nAt the ESIP Winter meeting in January we coordinated a panel discussion. Mentors from NASA, NOAA Fisheries, CalEPA, and Pathways to Open Science programs shared their stories of open science movement building through Openscapes. Look for a summary blog post in March!\nFebruary through May, five research teams from the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Center for Environmental Measurement and Modeling (CEMM) are participating in an Openscapes Champions Cohort with help from new Mentors Gayle Hagler and Jeff Hollister.\nThirty Openscapes Mentors across all of our programs and the Openscapes core team are coming together in their own six-session Cohort to practice Mentoring with a Coach Approach, led by Tara Robertson, professional coach and Openscapes advisor and collaborator.\n\nComing up\n\nNominations open for our 2023 NASA Champions Cohort that will run April - June. Please spread the word for teams using NASA Earthdata and interested in migrating workflows to the Cloud.\nCommunity Calls with Ileana Fenwick, Aneese Williams and Alex Davis about their experiences leading the Pathways to Open Science program, and with Sean Kross describing the workflow creating kyber.\nIn June we’ll launch a brand new program, Openscapes Reflections! This will be a 3-week program, modeled after leadership coaching in a mostly self-paced format. It will offer structure and accountability for participants to reflect and plan on analytical and reporting workflows to improve daily habits and fuel institutional culture change.\n\nThanks for reading, and here’s to kinder science and the Year of Open Science 2023!"

    "text": "Starting our #tidytuesday hacky hours\nThis is our first community blog post by Openscapes Champion Allison Horst!\n\nHi everyone! I’m Allison. I teach data analysis, statistics and presentation skills to graduate students at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara. I’m also an Openscapes Champion.\nIn Openscapes we discuss the need to create supportive spaces, like coding clubs, for useRs to practice and grow their coding skills.\nWith Bren masters student Gracie White (@GracieGW), I’ve recently started a weekly hacky hour / coding club in Santa Barbara. Here, I’ll share how #tidytuesday has reduced our workload and planning, how we started and organize our events, and a few things we’ve learned so far.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n#tidytuesday offers a no-stress, low-effort coding club option for organizers\nComing off of two quarters of data analysis courses, a number of motivated students were looking for a stress-free way to maintain and grow their coding skills. Recognizing the momentum, Gracie reached out requesting that we start a coding club this quarter using RStudio’s #tidytuesday initiative as an impetus and opportunity for weekly social coding events.\nSo, what is #tidytuesday? As described by Thomas Mock (@thomas_mock) of RStudio and the R for Data Science (#R4DS) online learning community:\n\n\n“Every week we post a raw dataset, a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask you to explore the data…The goal of TidyTuesday is to apply your R skills, get feedback, explore other’s work, and connect with the greater #RStats community!”\n\n\nWhy is that so great?\nBecause it means that the groundwork for a short, productive session of data wrangling practice already exists, with very little effort on our end. Manageable #tidytuesday datasets are shared each week with background information, citations, and code to read them directly into R.\nAttendees are invited to bring any other code-related projects they’re working on, but having the #tidytuesday option means that there’s something for everyone to work on that week, and we don’t have to spend any energy to make it available or accessible. Another bonus: many #tidytuesday participants share their code and visualizations publicly, so anyone can explore examples to learn from what others have done!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHow we started our coding club.\n\nStep 1. We sent out a welcoming email with important information.\nOnce we knew we’d focus our sessions around #tidytuesday datasets, we welcomed people to join us. In our first email, we wanted to:\n\nWelcome people and share our enthusiasm\nInclude the date, time and location of our first event\nIntroduce the #tidytuesday initiative\nAsk interested people to add their name to our Google sign-up sheet\n\nWe sent out the following email to Bren students and other R-using friends in the UCSB community:\n\n\n“I’m very excited to share that we’re starting a Tidy Tuesday Coding Club next quarter. Our hope is to make this a fun, no-stress, and supportive weekly group where we can all work on our own coding projects, discuss challenges, share victories (and grievances), learn about cool new packages and functions, and keep the rust off of our R coding skills! Our first coding club will be DATE, TIME, at LOCATION. We plan to schedule a place each Tuesday (e.g. coffee shops, breweries, restaurants, etc.) where we can meet in the afternoon/evening and code together. You can bring your own code/data you’re working on, or participate in the”R for Data Science” online community’s #TidyTuesday initiative, summarized here: Join the R4DS online learning community in the weekly #TidyTuesday event! Every week we post a raw dataset, a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask you to explore the data. While the dataset will be “tamed”, it will not always be tidy! As such you might need to apply various R for Data Science techniques to wrangle the data into a true tidy format. The goal of TidyTuesday is to apply your R skills, get feedback, explore other’s work, and connect with the greater #RStats community! As such we encourage everyone of all skills to participate! We’ll be participating in #TidyTuesday each week, and we hope you’ll join us for some fun social coding (yes, those can coexist). Sign-up HERE to be included on future emails about the dates/times/locations of our Tidy Tuesday Coding Club. We look forward to seeing you there!“\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. We showed up!\nWe held our first event at a cool little brewery close to campus that satisfied some requirements:\n\nEasy to bike or bus from campus\nPlenty of seating and tables for computers\nFree and reliable wifi\nFood & refreshments available (at venue or very close by)\nNo loud events happening (e.g. trivia night, live bands, etc.)\n\n…and ~17 coders came out to join us!\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a pretty even mix of attendees working on their own projects (research, assignments, etc.) and those using #tidytuesday to practice wrangling and visualization.\nOne person remembered how (and why!) to work in R projects. Several of us re-learned a few things about the lubridate package for working with dates and times. For a few, even opening RStudio and reading in data after a long hiatus felt victorious.\nI was thrilled to be there with so many people who felt comfortable working alongside other R-users at all different levels. It was a fun, relaxed evening of coding together. At subsequent events we’ve had between 12 and 18 people (and at least one dog), which is perfect for the locations we’ve met so far, and new interested members continue adding their names to our sign-up sheet.\n\n\nStep 3. We follow up between events\nThe Wednesday or Thursday following each event, I send an email to the group with the time and location of our next meeting. I also include some code examples inspired by discussions or data wrangling efforts during that week’s coding club (and am adding them to a GitHub repo).\nMonday or Tuesday after the new #tidytuesday datasets are posted, Gracie sends an email welcoming people to join us that week with a short summary of that week’s data topic and code to read in the datasets directly.\nSo at this point, our effort as organizers is pretty minimal:\n\nMonday/Tuesday: Gracie sends reminder email + code to get #tidytuesday data\nTuesday: We attend our coding club (2 hours/wk)\nWednesday: I post my code examples on GitHub (takes ~30 minutes)\nWednesday/Thursday: I send a follow-up with next location + links to code examples\n\nFor now, that’s our low-effort, big-reward strategy for starting a social coding group!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome early lessons we’ve learned\nSome lessons we’ve learned very early on in our little coding club’s existence:\n\nYou don’t need a perfect plan to start a coding club. I’d been so worried about details that I delayed starting a coding club. I shouldn’t have. In our first few weeks I’ve learned that attendees are happy to participate in less structured, low-key social coding events - and that I don’t need to feel like a host every week.\nUse materials that others have already created to minimize planning effort. The goal of our club is to get and keep everyone coding frequently so that we can all maintain and grow our R-skills. For that purpose, using the existing #tidytuesday infrastructure makes a lot of sense.\nWifi is really important. As we learned last week, our sessions are way less productive if we can’t easily and quickly search examples, twitter, blogs, documentation, forums, etc. We’ve had to cross a couple of places off our locations list due to unreliable wifi.\nYou don’t need an expert in attendance, but it helps to have some people who can help with issues when people get stuck. In our group, most people have had 1 - 2 recent courses in R and are relatively independent when it comes to the basics. Still, it’s useful to have one or two people there who feel comfortable troubleshooting or can send people in the right direction.\nKnow your audience, and choose your format accordingly. Our “get together and code socially” format works for our group because we have a critical mass of semi-independent R-users who are able to work and learn at a level that makes sense for #tidytuesdays (basic data wrangling + visualization with the tidyverse). If that isn’t the case, another format (e.g. a coding club where attendees work through tutorials together, or where an instructor leads a short workshop on a different topic like in eco-data-science) might be more productive. Figure out the goals of your coding club first, try to anticipate the level of most attendees, and choose a format that will set them up to meet those goals.\n\nWe’re really excited about our young coding club so far, and will share what we learn as it continues to grow!"

    "text": "A note from Julie: Welcoming Erin Robinson to Openscapes\n2020 was a difficult year. I count myself fortunate that I was able to work remotely and that Openscapes was conceived as a remote-by-design initiative. The unexpected disruption of COVID-19 allowed 2020 to be a year that I worked on building Openscapes as a sustainable program so that we can mentor more researchers going forward. I focused on listening and learning, and figuring out how to refine and align Openscapes’ values to best meet the needs of researchers.\nPart of this work led to partnering with Erin Robinson to grow Openscapes together. With this blog post, I am thrilled to formally welcome Erin to the Openscapes team! Erin is a well-known leader in the open data and open science communities and has extensive expertise in open data stewardship, partnerships and community-building – to categorize just a sliver of the goodness she brings to Openscapes. Erin is the cofounder of Metadata Game Changers, a data management consultancy, and is a leadership coach, with focus on supporting open science, collaborative leaders. Prior to this, she was the Executive Director of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) from 2014-2020. Her expertise and communities both complement and overlap with mine and we share the same passion and vision for Openscapes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom my very first conversations with Erin, we have been able to think bigger and bolder about the future of Openscapes. We’ve reinforced our commitment to social justice movements through invited talks in 2020 at Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Summer Conference, The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) Roundtable on Incentives for Open Science, and NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) Monster Seminar Jam, and through several grant proposals we wrote to strengthen diversity, equity, and inclusion in further Openscapes work."

    "text": "Articulating Openscapes\nIn August we were fortunate to host an Openscapes advisory meeting supported by Mozilla. One of the key discussion points was how Openscapes is unique in the open data science training space and complementary to existing initiatives like The Carpentries.\nWe see open science as a movement, with a vast opportunity for mentorship, coaching, training, and community organizing. Open science as a movement puts people at its center: a community-driven approach. We see a need for excitement and empowerment around open science, with data analysis as an entryway for researchers to engage and practice open science as a daily benefit that becomes an enduring part of scientific culture. We see a need for listening, empathy, and meeting researchers where they are. Integral to this is the need to focus on inclusion, learning from traditionally underrepresented groups, and amplifying lessons from movements like Black Lives Matter and All We Can Save. We see our Champions Program being most impactful as a community-driven approach within the broader open movement, and it’s a challenge we’re excited to take on.\nIn December we participated in the Science Gateways Community Institute (SGCI) Focus Week to refine our sustainability and strategic plan. Focus Week’s ‘napkin drawing’ activity spurred articulating this vision for Openscapes as a metaphor. Since then, we’ve been working with Allison Horst, the amazing artist, data scientist, teacher, and Openscapes Champion, to illustrate this vision. In the open science landscape, there are many paths forward. Openscapes mentors are like park rangers who welcome and guide research teams through the open data science landscape, building new trails as necessary and helping everyone become stewards and champions as they become more familiar, confident, and work together. Here is a sneak-peek of work in progress:\n\n\n\n\nSneak-peek of Openscapes Rangers artwork in-progress by @allison_horst"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Note: Openscapes began to work with and onboard mentors over the summer of 2021 while also beginning writing the Openscapes Approach Guide to help document our process. This post focuses on what the California Water Boards mentors learned in 2022 as they led their own Cohort in the agency. This was the first Cohort to be “independently led” by mentors within their own agency, we hope the first of many! Thank you Corey and Anna for your continued and inspiring leadership in open and kinder science (and beyond).\nThis blog post is authored by Corey Clatterbuck and Anna Holder from the California Water Boards Office of Information Management and Analysis (OIMA). Here, we describe why we led a Champions Program Cohort at the California Water Boards and how we did it, including details about our process, outcomes, what we learned, and what’s coming next. See openscapes.org/champions for more background on the Champions program.\nAddition February 2023:\n\nSWRCB-Openscapes Book: Education and mentorship in open science at the California State Water Resources Control Board\n\n\n\nIntro to the OIMA | Openscapes Partnership\nWe joined Openscapes last year as mentors for multiple NOAA Champions Cohorts held in Fall 2021 – you can learn more about our experience as Cohort mentors in this blog post. This experience was so fulfilling that Corey transitioned into a staff position at the Office of Information Management and Analysis (“OIMA”) at the California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB; “Water Boards”) in early 2022. Operationalizing open science practices throughout the Water Boards is at the core of OIMA’s mission to enhance the value, quality, understanding, and accessibility of Water Boards data and information through strategic activities, coordination, and changing the culture of data management at the agency, which includes transparency of the Water Boards information management structure. The Openscapes Champions Program has introduced us to so many possibilities to help us meet our mission, and we are excited to continue to diffuse the Openscapes mindset and related concepts in our daily work.\nOne of our priority items for this year was to plan and execute a Champions Cohort at the Water Boards. While cohorts are typically led by the Openscapes team, this was the first to be led by Openscapes mentors and the first Champions Cohort at a US state government agency. We hope our story can empower others to connect with the Openscapes community and start building more open, kind, and inclusive working groups and workflows at their institutions!\n\n\nOpenscapes open access model enabled adaptation for our workplace\nWe started with the Champions Program section in the Approach Guide, which led us through each step of cohort planning and implementation. We created a behind-the-scenes timeline with internal due dates for items including those in the Approach Guide, ~10 weeks prior to cohort start. For us, this included items like management briefings, mentor onboarding, cohort team engagement, guest speaker invitations, and creating and editing call content based on the participating teams. We also created a program timeline to visualize the calendar of cohort calls, seaside chats, co-working sessions, and check-ins with the cohort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram timeline for the California Water Boards Cohort including Pre-program engagement, Openscapes Champions Program, and Post-program follow-up\n\n\nOpenscapes practices what it preaches regarding reiteration of workflows via the Kyber R package, built by Sean Kross (an educator, software developer, and long-time Openscapes collaborator). Kyber aids set up of Champions Cohorts, including the cohort GitHub repository and cohort call agendas, and we found it extremely practical and easy to use. For example, instead of copying and pasting old cohort call agendas from Google Drive and erasing old notes while retaining the agenda framework, Kyber includes a function to build each agenda which is eventually pasted into a Google Doc. If the Openscapes team decides to make programmatic changes to the core Openscapes program, these changes are easily edited within Kyber for use in upcoming cohorts. The Kyber README is clear on the repository’s functionality and steps to launch, but ultimately users will need to know the basics of R and GitHub to use it – a potential challenge for empowering Openscapes mentors who have less experience with these tools. Additionally, Kyber is built to function with Google Docs and Sheets, so its use highly encourages concurrent use of Google products.\nLastly, we piloted a couple of changes to Champions Program planning and lessons to customize the process to better serve our current organizational framework and needs.\n\nWater Boards management selected teams for this pilot cohort.\nWhile Openscapes uses Google products for cohort sharing, the Water Boards purchases Microsoft products. We continued using Google Drive and all associated programs for document storage and sharing so that we could reap the benefits of using Kyber, but we used Microsoft Teams to host all virtual meetings and group communication between calls. While setting up breakout groups was a bit more clunky than Zoom or Google Meet, cohort members were accustomed to using Microsoft Teams in their everyday workflow. Cohort teams were free to create their Pathway in any program of their choice, and we helped migrate them to Google Drive.\nWe changed the order and length of Openscapes lessons to center culture and connection to the Pathway, and to give us more time to dive into and discuss these topics. Specifically, we made all cohort calls 2 hours instead of 1.5 hours, and we moved the GitHub Clinic to Call 3 to help cultivate the Openscapes mindset during Calls 1 and 2 – namely, discuss space and place for discussion and community-building, as well as a growth mindset for approaching new ideas like GitHub! We also emphasized GitHub as a tool that supports workflows, version control, and documentation over a tool for coding, as many of our cohort members do not code regularly.\nAfter introducing GitHub as a tool to support documentation, we developed Call 4 to build on ways to document workflow processes & documentation through the Pathway.\n\n\n\nDocumentation through the Pathway\nOne of the best parts of participating in an Openscapes Champions Cohort is being able to dedicate time to thinking about what you do, how you do it, and how you might be able to do it better. While thinking about the concepts and workflows is great - the real power comes from taking the time to write things down. When we served as mentors it became abundantly clear that carving out space and time for documentation was critical - and when teams did allocate the time and energy to those efforts, they were better able to see opportunities for collective improvement and felt more empowered to make changes together. This not only helped teams make their workflows more open and transparent, but it also served as a way to build team comradery, collaboration, and trust.\nWhen we shared concepts around documentation with the SWRCB Cohort during the first and second cohort calls, members shared similar interests in the process:\n\n\n“Being able to find the data I need and not having to ‘know that person’”\n\n\n\n\n“I have on multiple occasions had to work with data that was generated by a different person or group and that I had no prior knowledge of. When the data is not well organized it can be very difficult to interpret what you are looking at, and without good note taking in the original document I’ve also run into the issue where the person providing me with the data also was unsure of what some of it meant. This takes a lot of time away from actually plotting or analyzing that data, and proper note taking / organization can prevent all or most of it.”\n\n\n\n\n“Make it easier for others to re-use my work, and easier for collaborators to contribute to it”\n\n\nWe focused on documentation in Call 4 so that we could include GitHub as a tool for documentation and discuss some great examples of documentation using GitHub, such as the much exalted Fay Lab Manual for workgroup identity & culture. We also highlighted Dr. Nick Hagerty’s repository on California surface water distribution as an example of project documentation, including a clear README, data dictionaries, and policies for contribution and re-use. We also discussed finding the right documenting “tool” for the job (and the team!). For internal work processes, perhaps documenting on SharePoint is sufficient and can already be easily included into the organization’s existing file folder organization system. GitHub can enable collaboration for projects that require or benefit from input from collaborators outside the Water Boards. We also integrated Champions lesson material from topics we weren’t able to teach this cohort, e.g. Jenny Bryan’s Tips for Naming Things which is typically in Coding Strategies for Future Us.\nLike most organizations, the Water Boards has documents, data, and projects that exist in different places with different sharing capabilities, paired with variable version control and documentation of where these items live. The Pathway is a tool that helped the SWAMP team (Surface Water Ambient Monitoring Program) document the commonalities of where items live, whether they should be re-organized, and collating this information as a part of a SWAMP manual for team members. The PFAS team (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) noted similar struggles, but instead plan to create a file organizational structure schema in a team-based data dictionary. Their data dictionary will also include file name standards and metadata crosswalks between different, commonly-used data sources. The Performance Measures team used their Pathway to document how each data system or program they use applies to the template Pathway topics – e.g., where and in what formats are data from GeoTracker stored, where can you find the GeoTracker metadata, etc. The team then summarized the issues from each data system in order to determine next steps for simplifying their workflows. Some folks struggled through the process because documentation is difficult and, despite team members recognizing its importance, many don’t have enough (or any!) time to commit to it. Despite all of that, each team developed an awesome pathway and are well on their way past the initial trailhead.\n\n\nCulture change requires talk, action, and time\nThe concept and practice of “culture” is central to this work - but can also sometimes feel a bit abstract and distant (insert generic hand wave-y gestures here). Culture, according to Daniel Coyle, New York Times bestselling author of The Culture Playbook, “is not about words or what we talk about. Culture is about behaviors and actions.” And a collective change in work behaviors and actions such as incorporating open science practices takes time to practice, implement, and support.\nEli Holmes, a fisheries biologist at NOAA Fisheries and amazing Openscapes Mentor, introduced the idea of early adopters and their role in cultural transformations at the cross-government 2022 Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) meeting (blog post). Eli describes early adopters of open science as people who understand & embrace new ideas and find ways to apply them in the workplace. While the enthusiasm of early adopters drives the diffusion of innovation within an organization, it can take many years for these ideas to become commonplace. As a result, it can be discouraging for early adopters to continue pushing for and implementing innovative ideas.\nWater Boards management curated the teams for this pilot cohort in part by actively identifying and pulling in early adopters of open science workflows, collaboration, and vision. However, that isn’t to say that culture change within our early adopter teams is happening quickly! As one might expect - normalizing language, process, and changing behaviors and actions to support more open workflows and mindsets can be a challenging shift for teams. Despite these challenges, our post-cohort survey suggested that ultimately, Openscapes did help individuals adopt an open mindset towards their work, their teams, and themselves - and that teams are now beginning the process of changing their processes, behaviors, and actions to be more open, inclusive, and kind:\n\n\n“It has been a great opportunity for me to slow down and take the time to evaluate / check-in on my work and team workflow / processes. Many of the things we discussed are totally in line with my personal philosophies / approaches but I haven’t really put time into thinking about how to establish those things through documentation. I tend to be an individual worker bee and appreciate the co-working concepts and getting more comfortable in that shared space to do work!”\n\n\n\n\n“How important it is to…give people the space to work and try new things. I think I’ve better internalized that it’s okay to share imperfect work.”\n\n\n\n\n“Now that more staff have been exposed to the Openscapes principles, I think I will be more comfortable suggesting the use of tools like Git / GitHub and code-based workflows. In general, I will also be more comfortable suggesting that we use better project management practices and think about things like documentation / reproducibility as fundamental parts of our work, and not just make those an afterthought.”\n\n\nThe progressive changes that cohort members identified fit right in with where our organization is on the theory of diffusion of innovation (i.e., we’re just beginning!). Additionally, Cohort members largely responded that other Water Boards colleagues would find the Openscapes Champions Program valuable – so we plan to expand and start connecting to other early adopters to further diffuse open science practices and mindsets in our organization!\n\n\nHow we’ll revise & relaunch in 2023!\nInternal outreach & open call for teams: Over 3,000 people work at the Water Boards, so there are surely more early adopters out there that we have yet to identify. As a result, we are planning presentations and open chat sessions with internal roundtables, work groups, and management about the vision, framework, and outcomes of Openscapes. After expanding our outreach efforts, we expect to use an open call for teams to assemble the next Openscapes cohort at the Water Boards. A pre-emptive thank you to NOAA’s Openscapes Mentors for providing examples of communicating the benefits of Openscapes to internal groups - in true Openscapes style, we will definitely be reusing and remixing their awesome material during this process at the Water Boards!\nRollout framework using internal tools: While Google Drive is a great platform for file organization, sharing, and real-time development, it is difficult to access & edit private drives without linking to a Google account first. Our alternative is Microsoft SharePoint, which may have a clunkier interface, but resolves access issues that members had to contribute to the cohort.\nDevelop an implementation strategy: Just like at other large and small institutions, Water Boards management use strategic plans to document priorities and make decisions about how their staff will spend their time to accomplish programmatic and agency missions. We will be drafting an Openscapes Implementation Strategy to document our OIMA’s proposed vision, goals, objectives, and expected outcomes of continuing to lead Openscapes Champions cohorts at the Water Boards, in addition to the implementation steps, target audience, and expected timeline. We are drafting the strategy in November and December 2022 and will begin distributing the strategy through the internal outreach process in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSWAMP team Environmental Scientists that went through the SWRCB 2022 Cohort"

    "text": "Background: How NOAA Fisheries Openscapes Cohorts Worked\nFrom October-December 2022, over 150 staff from six NOAA Fisheries Science Centers and two Regional Offices, as well as from the Office of Science and Technology participated in the Openscapes Champions Program, a professional development training program for transforming analytical workflows with open science. Through four Champions Cohorts and joint activities, NOAA Fisheries staff focused on developing a mindset for “future us” (Lowndes et al. 2019). We worked on developing a growth mindset to learn new systems and software, and practiced talking openly with colleagues and screen-sharing to improve how we work. We also learned about integrating new tools into our workflows, alongside real examples from NOAA colleagues from a previous Alaska Fisheries Science Center Champions Cohort of how learning these practices and tools in previous trainings have streamlined how they work.\nThroughout the fall, we co-led these four Cohorts as NOAA Fisheries staff mentors, fostering a supportive work environment that embraced constant improvement and peer support. In addition to the bi-weekly facilitated cohort trainings where we learned from the Champions Lesson Series and discussed our experiences with colleagues, we supported free-form cohort coworking sessions to support our colleagues’ processes, and themed cross-cohort sessions with topics like Pathways, Quarto, GitHub project boards, and attributes of “Agile” open science team workflow concepts (NMFS Openscapes Fall Tutorials). In addition to the cohort sessions, we as mentors met as a peer-group across all four cohorts bi-weekly to debrief on the week’s sessions, refine planned activities based on revealed needs, and also skill-shared tech and facilitating tips. This peer mentor cohort is a core element of the goal of Openscapes to support, promote, and elevate local open science leaders in order to support sustainable organizational change. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Zoom screenshots of participants in four Fall 2022 NOAA Fisheries Cohorts"

    "text": "What we did and learned together in our Champions Cohorts\nStaff participated in Champions Cohorts as teams, reinforcing the idea that we’re not in this alone, and providing colleagues with whom we could not only practice concepts and tools but implement them in a real-life work setting to get our stuff done. For each of the teams, the Openscapes training was just the beginning of a longer process. Over the short few weeks of the workshop, the teams felt that Openscapes provided them with the support and space to tackle “wish-list” tasks (tasks they intended to do as a team for a long time but did not have dedicated time for), value their progress, and shift long-term practices within their workflows. While each team tackled very different challenges and goals (ranging from documentation, to report writing, to developing analyses) they recognized  universal themes during the training: transparency, inclusivity, continuity, project management, and professional development.\nThe early weeks were devoted to exploration of the concepts of data and analysis pathways. Through discussions, teams identified common needs (through narratives and diagrams) to understand how data and analysis outputs were processed, stored, and incorporated into their own work. The process of writing out and discussing the entire workflow also helped teams understand the way the silo-ing of work (e.g., I do my job and then pass it on) led to low team awareness of issues (problems) and difficulty for the team to help itself (peer collaboration).  Common themes were collaborative reports, moving toward databases, standardized formats and version-control of data, and away from Excel files emailed or in shared drive folders with ever-changing version numbers in multiple formats that each are ‘wrangled’ in different ways for each team member’s task. Teams were also eager to change to data and analysis processes that would allow reports to be written in Quarto or RMarkdown, and shared and versioned with GitHub. Thus creating transparent and more easily reproduced reports where the data, data wrangling, and analyses are all explicit (via code) within the report. This would also allow teams to migrate towards a report in multiple formats: pdf, Word and html, all generated from the same source.\nTeams were not only focused on “tools”. Equally important were discussions around team communication: within the team and external to the team, for example, data and information providers and the end-users (e.g., regional offices or the public). This showed up as shared standard operating protocols, onboarding and offboarding procedures, and documentation. This was a way to put to practice the concept of “future us” for teams with turnover (particularly in remote and hybrid situations) and sustainably tracking inventories. Changing the nature and tempo of team meetings was also a theme. Many teams expressed that “coworking” sessions were helpful and eye-opening—these were not update meetings but rather times that people came to work on a task together, screensharing to expose and solve problems, and learn workflows from each other (for example: using gmail filters to manage calendar invites or GitHub notifications in a folder to be reviewed rather than streaming into your inbox).\nThe fall Openscapes training was a powerful opportunity for teams, and individuals, to step back and do a deep reflection and review their report or data science workflows. Adopting an open and growth mindset, they then worked together as peers and teammates to develop concrete ways to move toward workflows that embrace the open science ethos."

    "text": "Specifics from each Cohort\n\nAlaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC)\nAFSC supported 8 teams from 7 divisions across the center; 3 included cross-divisional partnerships. Teams focussed their energy on a range of important research issues supporting the AFSC mission including fishing tagging, fisheries survey design and preparation, marine mammals, genetics, shellfish, and fish life history. All of the teams developed their skills for improved analysis workflows, report writing, and manuscript preparation; promoting a culture of inclusivity and collaboration; intentional investment in on- and off-boarding processes; and integrated project management. All of this was achieved within the context of an expansion of open science within NOAA and the greater scientific community. The support and enthusiasm of AFSC leadership for AFSC to develop new skills and best practices is critical to AFSC’s continued organizational excellence.\n\n\n“Before openscapes, our group had the beginnings of some momentum to create general, centralized protocols and analysis pipelines. The openscapes program really pushed us to the next level and gave us ideas of how to implement what we were thinking of designing for our group. Our advisor has supported us taking time to continue working on this organization and really cares about reproducibility. We are set up well to continue implementing our repos and shared resources.”\n\n\n\n\nPacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC)\nAs our first time working with Openscapes, PIFSC staff across all four science divisions participated in the Fall Cohorts. Three of the PIFSC teams gave progress presentations at the final session. Highlights including the introduction of the Protected Species Division Open Science Hub (Figure 2), a clear vision of enhanced reproducibility, collaboration, and team culture from the Ecosystem Sciences Division team, and an improved pathway for processing published datasets from the Fisheries Research and Monitoring Division Life History Program team.\nWhile some PIFSC staff have been committed to open science for some time, there is growing momentum to make these practices more widespread at PIFSC. Openscapes participants have been equipped with tools and a community to begin or continue practicing open science. We are sharing what we learned with our broader work teams, and plans are in motion to showcase PIFSC open science at a seminar in Spring 2023. Momentum is building to modernize our workflows and products. However, more capacity and training will be needed. In an email to Ecosystem Sciences Division leadership expressing support for future Openscapes training, Research Oceanographer Phoebe Woodworth-Jefcoats stated that Openscapes training was \n\n\n“hands down the best training I’ve had in my 15+ years with NOAA.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The PIFSC Protected Species Division team created a newGitHub Organization andinformation hub (using Quarto).\n\n\n\n\n\nSoutheast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC)\nThis is the third Openscapes training that SEFSC scientists have participated in. The Fall 2022 cohort  expanded this open science movement to every division in our Center. We have continued to build out tools initiated by previous participants, increasing our efficiencies and engagement in collaborative project management with GitHub project boards. The Population and Ecosystems Monitoring Division’s Trawl and Plankton Branch plans to expand their use of GitHub for cruise planning and version control programming to process and analyze cruise data (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. The SEFSC Trawl and Plankton Branch team focused on “Where are we going and how do we get there”, and plans to do better documentation, use GitHub, which in the near-term involves setting up discussions to include more team members and set up collaborative processes.\n\n\n\nSEFSC staff are building repositories of standard scripts and incorporating better review of data products, leveraging the Git version control software in the SEFSC Organization under the NOAA-NMFS GitHub Enterprise. Our GitHub Organization facilitates collaboration and onboarding and centralizes our intellectual property under unified NMFS standard operating procedures.\n\n\nSouthwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC)\nThis was the first time researchers from SWFSC participated in Openscapes! In her post for the NOAA Fisheries Science Blog, Biological Science Technician Kourtney Burger talked about the value of having Seaside Chats with her Southwest Acoustic Ecology Lab (SAEL) team and connecting with peers at other Centers.\n\n\n“I transferred our recently revamped ADRIFT Field Methods manual to a Quarto web book. Previously, it was sitting in a google drive where it wasn’t easy to find and had accessibility issues. In just a couple hours, I was able to easily make a new repository, copy a Quarto template, and transfer the google document to a GitHub repository and an easy to navigate website!”\n\n\n\n\nNorthwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC)\nThis was the third Openscapes training that NWFSC scientists have participated in and as for previous Cohorts, this was a joint training with other offices. This provided a diversity of perspectives and helped participants understand the similarity and differences of data science tasks and challenges across the agency. A number of teams were participating for their second or third time and came with clear goals concerning improving workflows for the team’s large complex reports.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: NWFSC Ecosystem Status Report Automation team was united by working on reports with many contributors of maps, time series data that must be compiled into 20-page reports."

    "text": "Conclusion\nNOAA Fisheries is embracing cultural and technological evolution in our transition to open science. As part of this, we are taking strides towards standard best practices and secure IT workflows as it relates to internally and publicly sharing our scientific products, both in development and implementation. NOAA Fisheries scientists have put together a GitHub Vision Document and are working towards a GitHub Governance Team to pull what works from each Science Center. The result of these efforts will lead to a nationwide standard of more secure workflows, potentially more cost effective purchasing of tools, and more equitable distribution of these resources.\nWe’ve proposed additional partnerships with Openscapes via a 3-year grant proposal (with co-PI Holmes) that would further advance this movement. By creating more intentional opportunities (i.e. time and space) to seek and share guidance from one another, we inherently give our teammates a leg up on our respective starting points. When we critically and empathetically examine our workflows across teams, we foster an inclusive and psychologically safe work environment. We’re excited that the White House has declared 2023 as the Year of Open Science and to be part of this broader movement across government and science. \nThanks for reading! Please join us on January 26 at the ESIP Winter Meeting, where two of us - Adyan Rios (SEFSC) and Josh London (AFSC) - will share the success of movement building inside NOAA Fisheries, on a panel discussing “Better science for future us: Openscapes stories and approaches for the Year of Open Science”. Look for a follow-up blog and recording about this too!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "We want to share our work in a way that people can find it, use it, improve it, and cite it, or get credit for their contributions. For people who have participated in our programs like Openscapes Champions1, or Pathways to Open Science2, we want a robust way to add these to their CV as professional development. For contributors to our open educational resources, like the NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook3, we want them to get credit and visibility. For people who want to reuse or remix a slide from a presentation, we want them to feel great about it by providing an easy way to cite the presentation. To enable all of this, we created a Zenodo Openscapes Community as a semantically meaningful group of selected research products. NASA’s Transform to Open Science (TOPS) and the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement’s (CSCCE) Zenodo Communities were inspirations for ours.\nZenodo is a general-purpose open repository that allows researchers to deposit research related digital artefacts like research papers, data sets, research software, reports, lesson materials, and presentations. For each submission, a persistent digital object identifier (DOI) is minted, which makes the stored items easily citable (adapted from Wikipedia). Zenodo allows for versioning and we can preserve GitHub repositories in Zenodo too (GitHub itself is not a repository!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Openscapes Approach Guide gives instructions for our use cases, with pointers for things that might not be obvious to a first-time user.\n\nWhat do we curate in our Zenodo Openscapes Community?\nHow to add your existing Zenodo record to the Zenodo Openscapes Community\nHow to publish a new record in Zenodo to get a DOI\nHow to get a DOI for materials on GitHub\nHow to cite Openscapes publications\n\n\n\n\nOf course I want credit for my contributions! When we add an author’s ORCID ID to a Zenodo record, their ORCID profile is automatically updated. I learned of this bonus when I uploaded a post on which I’m a co-author, and then received email notification that this record had been added to my ORCID profile. Why is this so cool? An ORCID ID is a unique, open digital identifier that distinguishes you from every other researcher with the same or a similar name to you. My ORCID profile is a bit like a CV. I use it to collect my research publications (not limited to peer reviewed papers) along with things like education and service on boards. Having it automatically updated is great.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociating a Zenodo record with an author’s ORCID ID results in that record being automatically listed in their ORCID profile.\n\n\nWant to create a Zenodo Community? Play in the Sandbox first, where anyone can create and refine a draft Community before publishing it in Zenodo. Creating a Sandbox version forced me to recognize decisions to make before creating the real thing, like: needing to create it from an account that looks professional like “curator”, rather than my personal email username; or deciding what types of research products to include or exclude. This webinar section “How to create a community” screenshares a walk-through that makes things crystal clear."

    "text": "Entryways to open data science and the power of welcome\n\n\n\n\nRemote plenary at the ESIP Summer meeting, all artwork by @allison_horst\n\n\n\nMy plenary talk was called “Entryways to open data science and the power of welcome”, and the ESIP Conference theme was “Putting Data to Work: Building Public-Private Partnerships to Increase Resilience & Enhance the Socioeconomic Value”. I started off by defining “open data science” as the tooling and people enabling reproducible, transparent, and inclusive practices for data analysis.\nThe problem I’m trying to solve with Openscapes is that despite the power of open data science, many scientists struggle with data and code, as individuals. This is because we are rarely trained to work responsibly with data, and we’re also not trained to collaborate or work like a team. So this creates a culture where we don’t feel confident sharing our data analysis or being open about our challenges, and this is true even inside the research group. And this situation creates invisible friction when forming data-driven partnerships because people aren’t on the same page with what is possible and how they can participate.\nOpenscapes offers a contributing solution, which is to welcome scientists to open data science and empower resilient habits and mindsets – as teams.\nThis is how I visualize open data science, working with the amazing Allison Horst:\n\n\n\n\nI define open data science as the tooling and people enabling reproducible, transparent, and inclusive practices for data analysis. Art by @allison_horst\n\n\n\n\nI think open data science exists as a beautiful feedback loop, where using similar tooling promotes and streamlines teamwork. And also working as a team better equips you to learn new tools and practices. And with this shared mindset, the idea of team becomes ever-broadening and networked and also your abilities to interoperate and adapt to an evolving softwarescape also broadens.\nOur Ocean Health Index team was able to engage in open data science over four years by incrementally introducing tooling like open source coding into our workflow and establishing team norms (Lowndes et al. 2017). We had entryways to engage in this powerful feedback loop: The things that benefited us the most was leadership and trust — this enabled one of our team members to Champion open data science within our team, and for us all to agree it was worth the investment and learn and develop team workflows together.\nI created Openscapes as an entryway for other teams, so we can create more Champions within teams and communities and uncover data-driven solutions faster. And from what I’ve learned from open communities like rOpenSci, RStudio, and Mozilla, this starts with the Power of Welcome.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main cornerstone of Openscapes is the Champions Program, which provides mentorship for science teams. It’s designed to empower lasting habits and mindsets for resilient culture change, and to complement other efforts that are building tools and training individuals and that taught and empowered me how to be a Champion for open data science.\n\n\n\n\n\nA few major outcomes from the inaugural cohort in 2019 were the creation of inclusive learning communities for coding collaboratively and lab GitHub organizations that include co-created documentation about lab philosophies and codes of conduct. Additionally, teams established practices to collaborate remotely, which is a skill in itself — important for modern science under normal conditions but particularly now as they are forced to work remotely due to COVID.\nWe also shared tips that are more generalizable in a publication co-authored by the first Openscapes Champions (Lowndes et al. 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving forward, Openscapes is looking to build more partnerships with existing science communities to remotely mentor teams in open data science, with a explicit focus on trust, openness, and inclusion. We were energized with all the connections we made at ESIP, and excited for what is to come!"

    "title": "‘Join the Rebel Alliance’ - an Openscapes interview with Dr. Dawn Wright at MozFest",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Openscapes had the distinct honor to introduce Dr. Dawn Wright, Chief Scientist of Esri to #mozfest, Mozilla’s annual Open Festival in early March (session page, recording). The conversation emphasized how science can be both kind and credible. What do you think of when you read ‘kinder science’?\nCross-posted on the Esri blog\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to our Openscapes session at MozFest!\n\n\n\nDr. Dawn Wright shared her approach to science, kindness, and leadership through stories of other women that inspire her. She referenced Dr. Hope Jahren, saying that when she talks about science she “can’t keep her own story out of it”. In Jahren’s best-selling memoir, Lab Girl, Jahren shares her process, the late nights, the special people, and strange experiences that went into making some amazing scientific discoveries. Similarly, in All We Can Save, editors Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson and Dr. Katharine Wilkinson have curated stories from 50+ woman leaders in the climate movement, proving there is power in sharing your science by sharing yourself. And that is an integral part of open science.\nAnother scientist that resonates with Dawn is Dr. Jane Lubchenco. Lubchenco’s definition of “use-inspired science” (fundamental, cutting-edge science that is responsive to societal needs, especially around topics of sustainability, resource use, energy, health, and racial equity), helps us frame the scientific challenges we tackle through the lens of helping others. Dawn also shared how for many of us we have a strong sense of place, and of places being sacred. She took time to acknowledge the native peoples whose land she lives in (the Yuhaviaatum Clan of the Serrano Indians, now within the federally-recognized tribal government of the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians).\n“It is critical to add kindness as an ingredient to open science,” says Dawn. Scientists should be willing to share more of themselves – beyond the methodologies and data. As you share more of yourself, people will come to you for help, and thus it is critical that we use kindness as part of this process. We need a kindness that doesn’t put others down, that is not tribal, that does not separate or segregate. We need a kindness that lifts others up, that leaves people better than we found them, especially students.”\n\n\n\n\nDr. Dawn Wright at the LEGO Store in London :)\n\n\n\nOn the question of what is possible when you bring creativity and science together — Dawn says, “how about LEGO?! There is even a new LEGO map style for ArcGIS Pro, What a wonderful analogy to open science, in that similar to LEGO, you can continually build on top of what others have accomplished.” Through publishing and open sharing, Dawn says that you give your bricks to others and interoperate with bricks for reuse, especially with others that have not had the chance. (We also talked about how Lego is investing in alternatives to plastic)!\nFurther, when discussing using Star Wars for science storytelling, Dawn – in her Yoda voice – reminded us that “fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate, and hate leads to suffering.” In the same way, making technology that is easy for people to use is the path to openness. Ease leads to exposure. Exposure leads to adoption! This aligns with open science as we make our research as open and accessible as possible to fight the dark side (hence, join the Rebel Alliance)! This brought us back to use-inspired science where our research can help solve bigger societal problems.\nWe discussed racism as a spatial problem. Esri’s Racial Equity Unity Team is building a host of spatial solutions to foster environmental and racial justice. Dawn mentioned that the formation of this team and initiative is an important step for Esri, certainly in getting beyond the “performative hypocrisy of big institutions that issue racial justice statements that are not backed up by action.” Dawn acknowledged in particular, Clinton Johnson - a leader on the Esri Racial Equity Unity Team - who along with team members is building map templates, workflows, datasets, and apps to help communities and local governments focus their analyses through the lens of racial equity. Esri and partners are also making dashboards that spatially identify and track various practices such as redlining, gerrymandering, and inequality in vaccine distribution. Most recently the team in collaboration with the NAACP and faith-based organizations launched a new initiative to survey, track and analyze policing budgets, and thus reimagine what public safety should look like, neighborhood by neighborhood.\nWe asked Dawn her vision for the planet as she’d like it to be. She described a LEGO site called “LEGO ideas” where you can create something that doesn’t yet exist in the LEGO catalog. One example that she cited is a LEGO solar farm with pollinator-friendly ground cover, beehives, grazing sheep, and solar panels. And you can populate this with LEGO’s new line of minifigures that now come with different skin tones, hair textures, facial expressions, and outfits. What a great way to add even more ideas for more diversity and inclusion! “That’s what I want the world to be like: people coming together and helping each other despite their differences.”\n\n\n\n\nExpandable LEGO solar farm created by Rob Nokomis and submitted to LEGO ideas\n\n\n\nWe also discussed the many institutional barriers to open science. Dawn recounted an AAAS panel several years ago about institutional barriers to science communication. Institutions often fail to value engagement in science communication, including with policy-makers. And as a result pre-tenure faculty still may face institutional barriers in making science relevant to society (with academic success largely measured by specialist publications and grants). But academic culture is slowly changing and we need official channels to incentivize this important type of outreach, and include it as part of the reward system for promotion and tenure. Open science needs to be incentivized too. More are seeing the connections of this to promoting diversity, equity and inclusion too. This is part of how we bring openness and ultimately justice to our institutions.\nDawn said “I also want a world where we don’t have to keep revisiting the same problems that we thought were long since solved (be it metadata or racism) and as a result can truly move forward”\nOur lightning question round revealed that Dawn’s current favorite bike is a Pinarello road bike that she has named “Jedi Princess”, and the leadership lesson she keeps re-learning is the importance of self-care and managing energy well in a world of multitasking. A snapshot of one moment in her life that brings her joy is breakfast outside on the back porch with her dog Riley (she/her), where Riley insists on waiting for Dawn to be seated first before starting in on her food (video on Instagram). And her five favorite songs are:\n\n“The Scientist” by Coldplay\n“Beautiful Day” by U2\n“Hometown” by 21 Pilots\n“Hi’ilawe” performed by either Gabby Pahinui or John Cruz\n“Sedjedo” by Angelique Kidjo featuring Ziggy Marley\nBonus 1: Motion picture soundtracks (e.g., Tron: Legacy, A Beautiful Mind, or the Harry Potter films)\nBonus 2: See the playlist from my interview as part of the “Lost in the Stacks” podcast (the world’s only research library rock-n-roll show), on Georgia Tech’s radio station, WREK in Atlanta - (Episode 335 at https://lostinthestacks.libsyn.com/webpage?search=resilience&Submit=Search+)\n\nIn the group Q&A, we started off talking about the occasional disconnect between Esri’s software products and open science. Dawn hears this! In fact, before being hired by Esri she wrote numerous letters to them requesting needed capabilities in 3D and interoperability, especially for ocean data. So when hired as Chief Scientist fostering open science became a critical part of her mission. She is aiding open data initiatives and developers both within and external to Esri who are often a younger, vibrant part of the community. They are forging new best practices and culture along the way.\nOn the subject of moving beyond what one attendee termed as the “crusty metrics” in academia (e.g., the strictly “publish or perish” measuring stick by which so many are judged for promotion and tenure), Dawn says we need advocates that see value in the alternative outputs, beyond publications and citations. For example, why not accept impactful websites, data portals, and web-applications as part of a tenure dossier?. We need to find and be allies and advocates who will speak up on each others’ behalf and together be kindred spirits who will speak up and out – let’s be the open science Rebel Alliance!\nDawn ended by quoting “What you ignore becomes more, what you tolerate will take over, but what you challenge will change!” She said, “what you challenge will change – but you do have to take the steps to challenge” – a perfect way to end this discussion since “Challenge” is the theme of this year’s International Women’s Day.\nAnd may the force be with you! :-)"

Lisa attended Brown University, Boston University, and Northeastern University.\nQuick links:\n\nRecording of the presentation at the NASA Openscapes Mentors Call on Sept. 6, 2023 by Cedric Wannaz (MathWorks)\nTutorial: Using MATLAB on NASA Openscapes\n\n\nMore and more data is being made available for users on NASA’s Earthdata Cloud platform. NASA Openscapes collaborates with a community of user-support staff across ten of the NASA Earth science Distributed Active Archives (DAACs), with the aim to help researchers transition their computational workflows to the Cloud using NASA Earthdata.\nThrough the NASA Openscapes Champions, an annual program that supports cohorts of science teams, a number of researchers expressed interest in using the data hosted on NASA Earthdata with MATLAB. The initial NASA Openscapes’ JupyterHub platform hosted by 2i2c, and tutorials, were Python-based. However, to make this transition, users need to be able to use software tools that are familiar to them that enable access to the data and can process it. The NASA Openscapes team reached out to MathWorks, developers of MATLAB, to support the effort to integrate MATLAB into NASA Openscapes JupyterHub and tutorials. The goal was to enable direct Cloud data access from MATLAB. \nTogether, our two teams have successfully installed MATLAB on NASA Openscapes JupyterHub, visible in the screenshot below. It is now available for researchers participating in NASA Openscapes affiliated learning events to try out with Earthdata data. Researchers will “bring their own license” (BYOL) and will be prompted to input that information to access MATLAB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo MATLAB computing options on the Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub: Full MATLAB desktop (with IDE) and via a Jupyter Notebook interface.\n\nThe MATLAB implementation on Openscapes JupyterHub consists of\n\nMATLAB desktop: A full MATLAB, including the IDE (bring your own license1)\n15 MATLAB toolboxes available to use with the MATLAB installation\n\nIncluding: Mapping, Signal Processing, Statistics and Machine Learning toolboxes\nAs users identify additional toolboxes they require, this list can grow.\n\n\nIn addition, we’ve written a detailed tutorial to help users learn the system and process the data. The MATLAB tutorial from NASA Openscapes includes code examples, that cover:\n\nLaunching MATLAB in Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub\nLogin and Authentication\nAccessing data on Earthdata\nLaunching with AWS Console\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap showing sea surface temperature created from HDF5 data with MATLAB contour() using the AWS console (screenshot from the MATLAB tutorial in the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook)\n\nIt’s new to work with NASA Earthdata on the NASA Openscapes JupyterHub, and even newer with MATLAB! We are excited that teams participating in the 2022 and 2023 NASA Openscapes Champions program are already logging into Openscapes and using MATLAB on the platform and continuing to push forward NASA Earthdata Cloud access through MATLAB. We will share more results on this work at the upcoming American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting on Tuesday, December 12. If you are interested in this work, please get in touch (lisak@mathworks.com).\nTo learn more about using MATLAB with data on NASA Openscapes, watch the video presentation to the NASA Openscapes Mentors or read the MATLAB Tutorial.\nAcknowledgements: A special thanks to Erin Robinson of NASA Openscapes and Luis Lopez Espinosa of the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) for their collaboration on the NASA Openscapes MATLAB implementation and their contributions to this blog post.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nMany universities and research institutes have site-wide licenses for MATLAB – called “Campus-Wide Licenses” and “Institute-Wide Licenses”, respectively.

Co-authored with group leads from our inaugural Openscapes cohort – Halley Froehlich, Allison Horst, Nishad Jayasundara, Malin Pinsky, Adrian Stier, Nina Therkildsen, and Chelsea Wood – it really summarizes what we learned with the entire first cohort of Openscapes Champions and aims to welcome others to engage in open data science.\n\n\n\n\nArt by Allison Horst\n\n\n\nIn the article, we describe how we were hesitant about engaging in open science, and how our perspective has changed because we started talking about it, along with our data challenges, in welcoming spaces. We are now enabling and supporting open data science in our research groups, and we share the following three main ideas:\n\nNormalize data discussions: talk about data with your research group and colleagues\nIdentify and address shared needs: developing vocabulary around data challenges can help you find solutions and engage with the broader open data science community\nThink ahead for Future You and Future Us: always consider how to make it easier for others to understand and build from your work – especially when it is most likely to be you or someone in your research group.\n\nAnd we also share 10 concrete activities to put these ideas into action with your research group — called A ten-week plan for open data science in the article. We are interested to see how this works for other groups, and to learn what you would add as suggested topics and resources for additional weeks!

    "text": "Openscapes updates and momentum\nIt has been busy since the last post about our keynote at the useR! conference.\nMy Mozilla Fellowship that supported the development of Openscapes ended in June; the fellowship was a truly transformational experience and I continue to be an active member of the Mozilla community (and I do plan to write a piece reflecting how those ten months of support, mentorship, friendship, and so many opportunities and ideas has enabled so much beyond what you see here with Openscapes). When the Fellowship ended I took three weeks in July off; although I loved everything I experienced and did, I really pushed myself hard and needed a break.\nSince August I have been working on a strategic plan for Openscapes, including a vision for program sustainability and growth within and outside of environmental science. This has been possible due to generous support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and continued institutional support from NCEAS, where Openscapes is a proud part of the Learning Hub. Learning from and discussing with many folks in the open, data science, and environmental communities, I am exploring different models to continue growing the Openscapes program, including offering opportunities to sponsor or book complete cohorts for the Champions program, which would be really powerful for networks of research groups already collaborating in similar areas. Please get in touch if you’re interested!\nMeanwhile, we have been continuing to share the Openscapes story and perspective, which has led to a lot of interesting ideas that I’m excited to bring into the Openscapes lesson series and this website. Most recently I’ve been at several conferences — about building user- and community- friendly open data repositories with Dryad, open publishing platforms and incentives with FORCE11, and discussing community engagement and self-organizing systems at MozFest. This, along with continual learning and inspiration from the #rstats and open communities online, and locally through RLadiesSB, Eco-Data-Science, the Ocean Health Index, and NCEAS has given me a lot to think about and reflect upon. So there will be more coming soon!\nAlongside these programmatic-level updates, what is truly the most awesome is that the Champions have continued the momentum around open data science even since accomplishments we shared when the cohort concluded in May – and they are also truly championing it. Labs are continuing discussions about data and research group culture, onboarding and teaching each other, and other ways to make life easier for Future Us, and sharing this open mindset with others.\nA few examples:\n\nThe Wood Lab now has a statement about open science on their website’s research page, and Danielle Claar gave a talk titled “Open source software advantages for science” at the Ocean Obs Conference. Also, Chelsea Wood published about using drone imagery to tackle ecological vectors for human disease\nNina Therkildsen published about evolution in response to fishing\nBart DiFiore and Adrian Stier published about coral reef ecosystems from space\nMalin Pinsky was selected as one of Science’s ten scientists to watch this year\nNishad Jayasundara gave the convocation ceremony keynote at College of the Atlantic\nAllison Horst has added open practices to her data science & statistics courses for 100+ environmental science students, and kicked off another year of #TidyTuesday coding club\nHalley Froehlich became a new professor at UCSB and begins new collaborations with ‘where is the GitHub repo and what is the plan for the data?’ She has also testified about aquaculture on Capitol Hill and published about sustainable global food systems\n\nAmazing, and these are just a handful of their accomplishments! In addition, I especially love seeing them connected through Twitter and IRL, amplifying each other’s research and ideas.\n\nSo excited about all of this, and all that is to come!"

    "text": "Better science for future us\nThe start of Fall is nearly here and with the season change and back to school, we are reflecting on Openscapes’ work over the Summer and where we are headed this Fall. Several presentations this summer provided the opportunity to hone in on the language that our work is about “better science for future us”. “Better science” means science that is more open, reproducible, efficient, and also more diverse, equitable, inclusive, kind. And “future us” is ourselves, teams, communities in the next hour, week, decades – with a focus on onboarding ourselves and others to ongoing work.\nWe have now led 5 Champions cohorts with 35 research teams (and have 3 more starting - see below!). And we are seeing that the Champions program goals supporting better science for future us – like empowering open, team practices to accelerate data-driven research and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in science – are happening! Teams are creating GitHub Organizations for sharing code, conversations, and codes of conduct, and these practices are also now showing up in publications (e.g. Bastille et al 2021). They are also facilitating and teaching based on what Erin and I have learned and role model through Openscapes. Our work really centers on the common: discussing data workflows, identifying and addressing shared needs, and thinking ahead in an inclusive way while spending less time reinventing.\nThe summer was a reflective time for us. And we have been thinking about future us by creating the Openscapes Approach Guide! This is our ongoing contribution to helping future us as we continue to run Champions and Mentor Cohorts, and for future us that expands to other organizations that want to run their own Champions cohorts.\n\n\n\n\nThe Openscapes Approach Guide, v0.0.1"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Openscapes summit reflections 2 — Changing the way we do science\nThis article is cross-posted on medium.com\nIn March 2019 I witnessed environmental scientists become champions for open data science when we brought the inaugural cohort of Openscapes Champions together for a summit in Santa Barbara, California. The summit was supported by Mozilla and hosted at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) with the purpose of building relationships, sharing lessons learned, and igniting collaborations. This is the second of several blogs, with this one focusing on the themes that continually surfaced during our discussions. It was co-developed with Halley Froehlich, Adrian Stier, Allison Horst, Malin Pinsky, Chelsea Wood, Nina Therkildsen, Nishad Jayasundara, Christie Bahlai, and Sean Kross.\n\n\n\n“How do we lead our labs in doing open science right? Also, what is right?”\n\n\nThis was a question that kept surfacing during our discussions at the Openscapes Champions Summit. And the answer that we kept coming back to was that we need an open mindset and think not only about our future selves as individuals, but also about our future selves as labs. That means working together with lab members to try create workflows and institutional memory, so it is not so much about doing it right but about working together to try to figure things out a little bit better. This means we have to be comfortable with the fact that the softwarescape will always be evolving and improving. And that we can be open to new ideas for the lab even though we ourselves have limited time. And that is okay. But if we have an open mindset, we can create an open culture where we can reflect and evolve together as a lab.\nAs we explored in the first summit blog about becoming champions, at the summit we felt for ourselves that what we are doing with Openscapes is not just about coding and GitHub, it’s about changing the way we do science. As we shared our progress and challenges, here are a few strategies we came up to sustain an open culture in our labs.\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapes Summit, 2019, elevator selfie. Clockwise from bottom left: Julie Lowndes, Adrian Stier, Malin Pinsky, Nina Therkildsen, Sean Kross, Allison Horst. Center: Halley Froehlich.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have to be comfortable giving lab members agency in the digital space\nFor our labs to be efficient and leverage best practices from the open data science community, we need to be okay with lab members taking the lead. This is important because faculty do not have the time to do this themselves, and it is important growth and leadership opportunities for lab members. This means relinquishing some control over the way the lab operates in a digital space, but it also releases us from shouldering the burden of needing to know everything before teaching it to our labs – something that is unattainable but can still weigh us down mentally and slow progress overall.\nIt is okay for the lab to learn together and teach each other, in fact, it is really important leadership skills for scientists to develop, and the whole lab wins in the process. If we help set the tone of a lab culture of openness and collaboration, we can discuss strategies together and enable lab members to take the lead in setting up systems and making sure everyone has the opportunity to learn and participate.\n\n\n\n\nIn between work sessions at the AirBnB.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all need onboarding and offboarding plans for our labs\nOnboarding is the plan for integrating a new person into an organization or team. Although this concept is most familiar in industry, in science its need is equally clear: there are constantly students and lab members coming in and out of the lab. Traditionally, they have been setup with a set of keys and any lab protocols they might need to know. But now there is need to deliberately onboard them to become what Christie Bahlai calls “good digital citizens”. What do they need to know to be the best contributors to the lab, and to science? And what do they need to do before they leave to ensure there is not data and project knowledge lost when they leave? Since there are few opportunities to learn these practices in formal education, one place to learn it is in the lab.\n\nChampions will be creating onboarding and offboarding strategies for their labs, likely as checklists. We discussed how policies could include that when you folks leave the lab they will transfer ownership of Google Folders and fork GitHub repositories. More to come on this as it is developed.\n\n\n\n\nWalking to dinner via the Santa Barbara pier.\n\n\n\n\n\nHackathons are great strategies for labs to modernize workflows as a team\nWe talked about hackathons in the lab. Borrowed from the coding world, I think of hackathons as when a group comes together to work on something that isn’t their responsibility day-to-day. In the lab context, it is really useful for getting together to work on things that benefit the whole lab, but doesn’t fall under anyone’s day-to-day responsibilities. And they can be fun — this is a time for donuts and working in a different location.\nChelsea Wood talked about a few hackathons she has led with different collaborators: one on a large-scale international field project with multiple principle investigators, and one with her teaching assistants preparing for a course. Both involved being in the same physical place with everyone with a block of time so that everyone could focus and actually work on the same computer in some cases to discuss and set up a shared system. There is a lot more to say about hackathons, and we will continue sharing them in future posts.\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapesing at NCEAS.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen data science skills should be formally taught in our departments, and we should value the instructors that teach them\nWe discussed how open data science skills should really not be things we have to teach ourselves on our own time. Instead, they should be formally taught in our departments, with courses and continuing education available to anyone, including our students and ourselves. This means new courses offered, and dedicated people hired to teach them.\nWe learned a lot from Allison Horst sharing her experiences and strategies as a lecturer in an environmentally-focused graduate program offering data science courses. Over six years, she has transformed an inherited statistics course from being one of students’ least favorite courses to being one of their most valuable overall experiences. She is incredibly dedicated to her students and invests a lot of time making sure she is teaching them the best she can, which means she herself is constantly learning and then improving lessons. In addition to modernizing all her lectures with the tidyverse, she has taken what we learned in Openscapes to organize and share all her advanced course lessons online (stay tuned for the intro course lessons). And, she has just been recognized at the university-level for her efforts, as she won UCSB’s 2019 Distinguished Teaching Award.\nThis is a good take-home message to end this whole post: We need to change the way we do science and to help prepare our students for the data-rich world we live in. And this means we need open data science skills taught, and although most faculty do not have the bandwidth or expertise to teach such courses, there are fantastic and motivated teachers who can. We need to value the teaching and the teachers, and we all need to do our part to champion this moving forward.\n\n\n\n\nSummit closing hike in Los Padres National Forest."

    "text": "DAAC Internal Training - Knowledge From Within\nThroughout 2022 the GES DISC DAAC led internal trainings with our DAAC colleagues to give DAAC staff hands-on experience in the cloud. These kinds of internal trainings are being shared and leveraged by other DAACs, who will be exploring this same exact model and leveraging these materials in the future. The goals were to “walk a mile in the user’s shoes”:\n\nTeach cloud basics and definitions\nInteract with one cloud data access method: direct S3 access\nGrant access to cloud workspace\n\nHow did we do it? Step 1 was “Educate” - we presented and showcased cloud user resources at weekly meetings ahead of workshops, inviting people to join our workshop to learn hands-on. Step 2 was “Prepare” - we split participants by skill and experience level with Python and cloud computing. Step 3 was “Interact” - we taught with bite-sized lessons using Jupyter Notebooks, and encouraged folks to follow hands-on through our teaching style of live-coding and type-along during this interactive workshop.\nHow did it go? We taught 33 colleagues this way. In terms of skill and comfort level in advance, there were 12 Beginners, 14 Intermediate, and 7 Advanced. Positive feedback included: “More simple & straightforward than I thought”; Breaking up code pieces helped; Pre-filled notebooks useful to refer to; Easy to follow; GitHub clone was easy!; Breakout rooms for troubleshooting. Challenges included: Window/tab management; Too much material; Live-coding typing was too fast; Continue to define jargon/terminology throughout the workshop. We also asked about prerequisite knowledge colleagues would have benefited from, and they listed familiarity with Earthdata tools; Basic Python; Basic cloud (AWS) understanding & terminology; Account set up for cloud access.\n\n\n\n\nWhat did we learn from internal training: four key elements.\n\n\n\nOverall, we had four main lessons learned:\n\nLearning curve is steep! No one left an expert and we continue to help staff who are experimenting in the cloud\nProvide resources that are easy to revisit! Website, slides, instructions, recordings are all useful for staff who spend more time with the material\nContinued support and education are critical - Necessary to host refresher workshops to exercise the knowledge and introduce new tools and methods\nLay a foundation with cloud basics and terminologies - Introduce terms and concepts early, perhaps in a separate meeting or clinic, and continue defining them throughout the workshop"

Learning objectives focus on how to find and access ECOSTRESS v2 data from Earthdata Cloud either by downloading or accessing the data on the cloud.\n\n\nLP DAAC University Events\nApril, May 2022\nA series of Jupyter Notebooks, written in Python, demonstrating how to get started with NASA Earthdata in the cloud. Topics include: Cloud Data Access in AWS, Cloud Optimized Data, Data Discovery using STAC via NASA’s CMR-STAC API, Working with Cloud Data.\n\n\n\n \nThe main outcome was that these events markedly raise cloud comfort level.\n\n\n\n\nUsers’ comfort levels before and after training\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the “why” was a big part of this - why move workflows to the Cloud. Learners’ takeaways predominantly centered around improved conceptual understanding of why and when to use, or not use, the cloud… while also recognizing that there is a significant learning curve and time investment required for adoption.\nWe also saw common pain points: inconsistent data availability and service offerings leads to difficulties reusing a given workflow; lack of common and robust learning resources; the Earthdata Cloud ecosystem is complex and overwhelming, leading to difficulties knowing when to use a given workflow or tool/service.\nMoving forward, we have ideas for supporting users in the Cloud:\n\nRecognizing easy cloud access as a core service - our 2i2c Jupyter Hub has been critical for reducing barriers to cloud entry and having a shared environment to meet users where they are (see this blog by Luis Lopez for more).\nContinuing to close the loop between the users we work with and our engineers to build solutions together - leveraging the 2i2c environment as we understand cost and funding mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\nIdeas for supporting users in the cloud"

Using this library eliminates the need to know the intricacies of NASA’s Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and cloud data storage systems.\nCurrently, in order to programmatically access NASA datasets, users must be familiar with many APIs (we call this “API fragmentation”), including EDL (How to use it with OAuth, CURL, WGET etc, and .netrc); CMR (How to query for what we want, How to read the metadata that CMR returns); Cloud (AWS, S3 buckets, S3 credentials), etc.\nearthdata will abstract this complexity for the user so that they can run a few lines of Python code and have the output return their query as Python objects, and they can carry on with their important science!\n\n\n\n\nExample code using earthaccess.

An exciting group of advisors (full list below) did “prework” before the meeting to get a sense of Openscapes’ vision, program, and momentum. This minimized spending in-person time on background in favor of hearing more from every participant.\nThe pre-work included everyone preparing a 5 minute statement where they shared with the group 1) an introduction to the person their work, their communities, their vision; 2) something they think/do/use/know that has improved their work, leadership, or impact that would benefit this group (could be process, technology, a cautionary tale…) and 3) what is the hardest part of your work. (The idea for that last question came from Kirstie Whitaker during a conversation at MozFest 2019).\nFolks shared really interesting stories and perspectives building from their work. They lead trainings for researchers as well as for leadership, and build and support learning communities like Life Science Trainers, BioData Club, H3ABioNet, ASBCB, Community of Bioinformatics Software Developers, LIBD rstats club, Mozilla Open Leaders, and E2M2: Ecological and Epidemiological Modeling in Madagascar. From their statements we discussed further as a full group, asking questions, finding synergies, and developing a better understanding of some of the different approaches and efforts going on in this space."

    "text": "Goal 2: Reflect on themes and shared needs\nPerhaps the biggest recurring theme was the importance of community. We talked about this from a leadership perspective in terms of the importance of letting other people in and a mindset where you can learn from anyone. This attitude is key to an inclusive program and they are a critical sustainability strategy as well. Finding ways to center community building is the way to make efforts more sustainable. Including others means you getting more comfortable sharing imperfect work and delegating is a great way to train & level-up community members to take on more leadership.\nAnother theme was how working in open data and open science spaces brings up feelings of loneliness, not fitting into a ‘normal’ domain, shame or ‘not doing it right’. And how these feelings lead naturally into conversations around empathy, resilience and collaboration. Kindness and thinking more deeply about what you DO bring to the table is a helpful strategy.\nWe talked about engaging with different audiences and the importance of curating information: the need to both communicate information AND protect people from (irrelevant or distracting) information. This means curating information and annotating it for different audiences to help them make better decisions as they engage. This is particularly important to foster buy-in from leadership that supports the time and effort involved for others to learn.\nAnother topic was about how research groups are often not trying to do open science – they are trying to make their analytical experience less painful. This brought up the idea of the “trojan horse”: meeting analytical needs but also introducing open science practices at the same time. This also tied into how providing motivation is a big part of our work, and how important storytelling is for motivation. Sharing your learning path, and showing humility and vulnerability, can be some of the best traits in a teacher."

    "text": "Goal 3: how to improve Openscapes going forward\nAs break-out groups we focused on specific questions for Openscapes: What gaps or opportunities do you see for Openscapes? What could make Openscapes better suited for biomed communities? What existing needs do you see as unfilled in your biomed communities?\nWe talked about time as a big issue; how to help folks prioritize Openscapes/open data science with their other responsibilities? Advice here was to focus on the value exchange: illustrate how it’s worth the time spent, and be clear what they’ll be getting out of it. This means being very cognisant of the cost/labor involved in participation being very explicit of offering incentives and rewards. Encouraging people to make community activities and learning part of their job instead of something extra. With storytelling, focus on what the journey could look like for research teams: Your lab is doing A, B, C, this is what the journey to D, E, F looks like. On the other hand, you don’t want people to overcommit. So in addition to the value exchange, perhaps there is a lightweight version of Openscapes that could have different levels of lessons, messaging, intensity, etc.\nWe also discussed that identifying and naming explicit roles can be very effective – both at events but also within research teams.\nProgrammatically, we need to focus on what makes Openscapes unique, and communicating that it has staying power. People love to spin up new stuff but is this initiative going to stick around?"

There is a lot more to reflect on but one of the biggest take-homes for me was around communicating the vision and the services Openscapes provides, and how it fits in and complements other existing efforts. And also thinking about the value exchanges for participants. Engaging in open data science is not only about time and effort – which are substantial – but also about changing the way we’ve been working for our whole careers. Both time and change are hard, so how can we really focus on meeting scientists where they are and providing them with what they need."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Cross-posted on rOpenSci\nAt their closing keynote at the 2020 RStudio Conference, Hilary Parker and Roger Peng mentioned that they hatched the idea for their excellent Not So Standard Deviations podcast following their reunion at the 2015 rOpenSci unconf, (“runconf15”). That statement went straight to my heart because it pin-pointed how I had been feeling throughout the week of RStudio Conference that I had been unable to name. At rstudio::conf, I was surrounded by so many of the incredible people I had met at that very same runconf15. These folks are visionaries and leaders, founding and leading global efforts in open source software and inclusive culture, and the fact that they were all together at a small event convened by rOpenSci holds great significance. I am so honored to know this community, and to consider them allies and friends. The RStudio Conference (“rstudio::conf”), a conference with 2400 people, felt cozy with their presence and with the visible efforts they have led to make R and beyond a welcoming, innovative space. In a follow-up to an earlier blog summary of rstudio::conf(2020), here I want to reflect on how important runconf15 was, and how truly unique and gamechanging rOpenSci is.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe 2020 RStudio Conference felt monumentous to me personally because it marked five years of me being in the #rstats community (which I define broadly to be the deliberate, inclusive, and welcoming culture around R and that visibly exists on the Twitter #rstats hashtag) . #rstats has not only upgraded my analytical practices, but it has also changed the trajectory of my career and life: it has upgraded my skillset and also my mindset and expectations of what is possible for scientific research and beyond. I mentioned this in my 2019 useR! keynote, but I intentionally did not really talk about it. What I could not say in that keynote was describe really at all how important rOpenSci — the program, leadership, and community — is to me because I can’t talk about it without my voice wavering with emotion. But here, written, I will try.\nMy entryway to #rstats all started with a single person who welcomed me: Karthik Ram.\nKarthik is a data scientist, an ecologist, and a world-changer. He not only co-founded, built up, and leads rOpenSci, but also leads efforts at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science and the US Research Software Sustainability Institute, among a million other things. He is an incredibly warm, thoughtful person, and he first said hello to me when he was co-teaching the Open Science for Synthesis course at NCEAS where I am based (but was not attending). I met him in the hallway one day and he asked me about my work and told me a bit about rOpenSci.\nrOpenSci brings software developers and users together to innovate on creating new coding tools and promoting open science. It does this by deliberately creating a friendly, positive environment where folks with different backgrounds and expertise feel welcome and comfortable to learn, share ideas and innovate together. rOpenSci exists primarily online, through its extensive staff- and community-developed and ever-growing ecosystem of R packages, Community Calls, discussion forum, Twitter and Slack. It also catalyzes relationships and strengthens community through in-person “unconf” events, bringing community members physically together to collaborate on specific projects of their choice.\n\n\n\n\n \nThe 2015 rOpenSci unconf (“runconf15”) was transformative for someone like me, so new to coding. Beforehand, I was pretty scarred by my experience coding, and really thought that software was a static, untouchable, and unalterable thing, sort of like a refrigerator that did Its Purpose and Too Bad if it doesn’t work quite right or limits your imagination of could be possible. Honestly, my closest inkling that I could interact with software or software developers was through Clippy.\nBut at runconf15, I learned not only that software developers were real people, they were kind people. They were kind people who would take time to talk to a new user/marine ecologist like me, and be interested in my use cases, questions, needs, and learning process. My colleague Jamie and I were able to talk with RStudio’s Joe Cheng about our pitfalls and limitations of working with raster map data in R. And then we were blown away as Joe began coding a package to make rasters faster right before our eyes, in dialogue with us as we sat together.\n\n\n \n\n\nHaving these kind people (note: “kind people” not “kind of people”) all together ready to innovate does not happen by accident. It takes deliberate intent and attention to bringing us together and setting the tone in a comfortable space to interact. And this was the vision of rOpenSci. This runconf15 was the first time I heard a Code of Conduct. And it was the first time I had experienced a large setting without hierarchy, and felt like I belonged and could contribute in a way that was welcomed.\nI’ve been thinking back to rOpenSci’s runconf15 event five years ago. My interests, time investment, and career focus on kinder science was definitely catalyzed by runconf15, and then reinforced by other’s efforts from this very same event. Those runconf15 participants who were already #rstats influencers…were they catalyzed as well? Hilary Parker and Roger Peng said that their NSSD podcast idea came out of rOpenSci’s event. How about Tracy Teal, who became executive director of The Carpentries, Gabriela de Queiroz who had created and then turned RLadies into a global movement, Arfon Smith, who went on to lead the Journal of Open Source Software, and RStudio, who increased their team and customer base by an order of magnitude in five years and who launched rstudio::conf in 2017?\nrOpenSci made concerted efforts to continue building and nurturing this community after runconf15. This means leveraging the power of the internet, where conversations ignited at runconf15 was continued with enthusiasm and innovation.\n\n\n \n\n\nBut rOpenSci is all about welcoming more and more people into the rOpenSci and #rstats community, as is evident in part from runconf16, runconf17, and runconf18, and the 28.2K Twitter followers (as of February 2020). rOpenSci has created a friendly watershed of innovation, with a growing network of diverse people and skillsets contributing in myriad ways, like streams joining a ever-stronger flowing river.\nAnd what I am trying to do with Openscapes is to connect additional tributaries to this rOpenSci watershed. I think that the most important thing I do here with Openscapes is to pass forward what I’ve learned from rOpenSci leadership and community, and welcome additional scientists to join. When we talk about the awesomeness of R communities in our mentor sessions, it’s not only to encourage them to become a part of them, but also to extend its ethos and kick-start kinder science around them.\nThank you rOpenSci leadership and the greater community for being so welcoming and supportive of me and everyone like me."

    "title": "Hello Quarto! A Chat with NASA Openscapes, co-hosted with R-Ladies Santa Barbara",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Our 6th Openscapes Community Call co-hosted with R-Ladies Santa Barbara featured a “celebrity interview” with NASA Openscapes Mentors Amy Steiker, Catalina Oaida Taglialatela, Aaron Friesz, with J.J. Allaire, lead Quarto developer and CEO of RStudio. The conversation was led by Sam Csik of R-Ladies Santa Barbara.\nQuarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc that allows users to create dynamic documents, presentations, websites, and more. What is especially unique about Quarto is that it works seamlessly across multiple languages -- R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS -- allowing for easy collaboration among users from different backgrounds and areas of expertise. Conversation was centered around the experiences of NASA researchers from different Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) using Quarto to enable collaborative, data-intensive, open science in the cloud. The recording is on Openscapes YouTube.\nJulie Lowndes is the director of Openscapes, and co-lead of NASA Openscapes with Erin Robinson. Julie is a marine ecologist turned open data scientist because she was so empowered by the R community. Sam asked Julie to describe Quarto - that she had heard it described as “a document, a system, and a way of life”. Julie confirmed -- Quarto is a document in that you can write prose, code, and render outputs like figures and tables all in one place (and also present it in a beautiful way!). She loves that it has a very similar feel to RMarkdown, yet Quarto as a system extends all the RMarkdown functionality that many R users already know and love to additional languages . And finally, this powerful system can become what feels like a way of life because it informs the way she works and collaborates both with herself and others.\n\n\n“As an R user collaborating with other R users, Quarto refines my RMarkdown experience. As an R user collaborating with Python users, Quarto helps us really reimagine how we work together.” — Julie Lowndes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulie screenshared a rendered Quarto document alongside the .qmd (“quarto markdown”) file that generated it in RStudio. She pointed out how similar .qmd files look and feel to .rmd (“R markdown”) files, and that there isn’t a rush to make the switch from .rmd to .qmd if you don’t want to -- but the migration is smooth if you do!\nCatalina Oaida Taglialatela is an Applied Science System Engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and The Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO DAAC). Catalina is focused on increasing the number of researchers who use NASA data by helping identify and reduce barriers to science when data and services are in the cloud. She shared that Quarto has enabled her and her teams to curate and organize materials from GitHub repositories in a way that is easy (and oftentimes, less intimidating) for data end-users and/or collaborators to engage with. The NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook, a Quarto website built by the NASA Openscapes Mentors, showcases clear step-by-step How-Tos on searching for and using Earthdata, in-depth, targeted tutorials and workshops, and also lessons that are currently under development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatalina commented that sharing works-in-progress was a new concept and certainly one that took some getting used to, but she hopes that this increased transparency will facilitate learning among those who are looking to expand on the work that her NASA Openscapes cohort members are doing.\n\n\n“Before Openscapes and Quarto, I was hesitant to put unfinished tutorials or ‘how-to’ notes on a public platform, but I’ve really come to appreciate this new open way of collaborating and developing in a way that lets others learn and scale up our efforts. I see Quarto as a tool that enables us to open up and share our process and artifacts in a way that is friendly to the broader data user community.” — Catalina Oaida Taglialatela\n\n\nAmy Steiker is the Data Service Engineer at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and specializes in creating data education resources, tools, and data transformation services. If you already love making slides in xaringan, it’s time to check out Quarto presentations! In just a few short weeks, Amy and her team were able to build some really stunning slides using Quarto for her 2021 American Geophysical Union (AGU) talk (check out the slides and use their source code as inspiration for building your own!). She stressed that while it at first seemed daunting to tackle this in a short period of time, the Quarto infrastructure made it really quite simple to generate content from a Jupyter Notebook with Python, preview changes “on the fly” to get slide formatting just right, and finally publishing and presenting it. Amy’s slides were some of the first ever(!) created with Quarto, providing both a challenge and an exciting opportunity to come up with creative solutions. As early adopters, getting the chance to try things out and work alongside J.J. and the Quarto developer team made it possible to push the limits of what was possible, and in some cases, inform Quarto features.\nJ.J. Allaire is the lead developer of Quarto and CEO and co-founder of RStudio, where he is focused on supporting technical publishing, data science, and open science. When asked about his motivation for developing Quarto, J.J. spoke first about RMarkdown -- for 10 years now, RMarkdown has empowered people to publish, communicate, and work reproducibly. For folks who are familiar with the R programming language, it has been an indispensable tool. A large motivation for developing Quarto is the ability to extend the best features of RMarkdown (and more) to Python (and Julia & ObservableJS) users, like the NASA Openscapes Champions. J.J. also discussed how the RStudio Visual Editor (in the IDE) has been developed in concert with Quarto, making it easier to write text and prose - whether you are a seasoned markdown writer or not.\nAaron Friesz is the Science Coordination Lead at NASA’s Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC). Aaron provides user needs insights and technical support for archive and distribution, service development, and outreach activities, including developing tutorials, scripts, and presentations. He pointed out that there was an initial learning curve when getting their Quarto infrastructure and development workflow set up, but that it was an awesome opportunity for all NASA Openscapes Champions to learn together and begin collaborating. Now the team has a framework that is open and automatically published (thanks to GitHub Actions) as they continue to iterate. Aaron has seen how Quarto can empower developers from different backgrounds -- using this tool, it’s no longer “R vs. Python” but rather a seamless integration of the two to produce common (awesome) tools. Aaron screenshared what it looks like to use Quarto with Jupyter Notebooks in the NASA Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAaron screenshared the _quarto.yml file, created in JupyterLab, which underlies the rendered navigation bar found on the 2022 ECOSTRESS Cloud Workshop website. Aaron pointed out that content for each menu item can be created as markdown files (.md) or Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb), as shown here, or even include RMarkdown (.rmd) and/or Quarto markdown (.qmd) files (among others). This interoperability makes collaboration among different language users working on the same product relatively seamless.\n\n\nLearning new tools can be intimidating, but just as the NASA Openscapes Mentors demonstrated, it is always more fun with a group of supportive friends and colleagues. We were thrilled to be joined on this community call by an engaged and excited audience full of both new and seasoned Python and R programmers, all looking to explore Quarto together. Following the “celebrity interviews” (editor’s note: Sam is an outstanding interviewer!), panelists and participants moved into Zoom breakout rooms to close out the evening with some R-Ladies Santa Barbara-style networking -- question prompts ranged from icebreakers to casual discussion on what folks were interested in using Quarto for. If you’re looking to get started on your own journey but aren’t quite sure where to begin, be sure to check out the event recording! You’ll find a live demo of the RStudio Visual Editor, how to add automatically-generated citations to your Quarto document by just supplying the DOI, and more."

    "text": "Task: Port the Openscapes website from blogdown to Quarto\nTo start, what does port mean? While it may be obvious to some, I feel like this word is sort of jargon-y. I first learned of it when Quarto was thrust into the spotlight and the R community at large began “porting their websites from distill/blogdown/etc to Quarto”. I came to understand that (at least in this context) “port” means “to convert or migrate” a website from one framework to another (or in other words, rebuild a website using different tools).\nSo why the need to port the Openscapes website to Quarto? Julie originally built the site back in 2018 using blogdown and the Universal Theme for Hugo (you can still check out the GitHub repo) – and it was really beautiful!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the old Openscapes website’s landing page, built using blogdown.\n\nUnfortunately, upgrades to Hugo were beyond Julie’s scope to maintain which meant the site could no longer build locally (i.e. you couldn’t preview the site on a personal computer). This meant that the site needed to be redeployed in order to view any changes. Not only was this a rather slow process, but it also meant that there was no easy way to test out new additions/pages/features (or even check for typos) before sharing those updates with the rest of the online world. Additionally, the Openscapes team has used Quarto since its earliest days (read more about that in their quarto blog posts) – it seemed like a good time as any to begin using this same tool for building the Openscapes website as well."

My real job involves teaching data science skills to students in the Bren School’s Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program – this includes teaching students how to build a personal website using Quarto, how to customize Quarto websites using Sass & CSS, and how to add a blog to their Quarto website.\nHowever, all websites I’ve built/contributed to/taught about have been personal websites (e.g. like my own, https://samanthacsik.github.io) – oftentimes, these leverage a special template to easily arrange the contents of a website’s landing page. Rebuilding the Openscapes website meant diving deeper into custom layouts, responsive web pages, and generally, a whole lot of stuff I had little to no familiarity with…which honestly really scared me (aren’t freelancers supposed to know how to do what they’re being hired to do??). With Julie’s reassurances that not knowing was okay, and that there was time and space to learn together (very on brand for the community she and her team foster through Openscapes ), I set off on my first freelancing adventure."

    "text": "General Porting Process: Easy stuff first, then lots and lots of learning and iterating!\nDespite the fact that I was leading the charge on most of the technical aspects of this project, porting the Openscapes website was truly a collaborative effort involving myself, Julie, and Stefanie Butland, one of the core Openscapes team members and someone I’ve gotten to know through attending past Openscapes events.\nSteps for porting the website generally looked like this:\n\nRecreate as much of the website as possible: I created a Quarto website that looked as close as possible to the original blogdown site – this meant getting the main website pages and blog content moved over without much fussing. The most challenging part was creating a custom landing page that both matched the aesthetics of the blogdown site and that looked good on smaller viewports/mobile devices – this ended up being the last thing I addressed before wrapping up the project. Ultimately, I was able to recreate a Quarto-based Openscapes website that looked nearly identical to the blogdown version – it was really cool to see how flexible Quarto allows you to be!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the new Openscapes website’s landing page, built using Quarto! We were able to recreate the landing page so that it looked pretty darn similar to the blogdown site.\n\n\nIncorporate events: Openscapes Events were historically announced through a separate Events blog, which we decided to incorporate fully into the Openscapes website on its own events listing.\nFeedback & updates: Stef and Julie did multiple deep dive reviews of the website and I made changes based off their suggestions/requests. Some of these were minor (e.g. “Can we add a bit more vertical space in underlined text”, “this hyperlinked text is broken”), while others required a bit more thought (e.g. “let’s rethink how we structure content on this page”, figuring out CSS to style particular page elements). They also had the chance to share the website with a focus group, which provided invaluable feedback on content organization, language, etc. (e.g. “remove unnecessary text from the landing page”, “replace the words instructional materials with curriculum”)\nMore feedback & updates: The hardest part and also the most fun part was the back-and-forth discussion on how to rethink, try out, and change the website. We fiddled a lot with content reorganization and CSS styling to better highlight different resources/elements. It was a super collaborative and iterative process to get things to where they are now!\nFigure out responsive web pages: I saved the most technically challenging part (at least for me) for last – learning how to create responsive web pages (where content adjusts size and positioning based on viewport size) involved a lot of trial and error.\nDeploy with Netlify & troubleshoot redirects: It took us a minute to understand how to get redirects to work. I won’t go into that here, but you can read about our solution on our redirects wiki."

    "text": "Reflecting on the stand-out moments\nBuilding this website has been a real journey (a 6-month long one)! While I can’t recount all the details here, I did want to reflect on a few things I’m most excited about:\n\nGreatest victory: responsive web pages\nA responsive web page is one with elements that automatically resize and reorganize based on the size and shape of the viewport and/or device it’s being viewed on. This responsiveness is critically important for ensuring a high quality user experience, no matter how a user is accessing the website.\nFor example, note how elements organized in columns (e.g. Engage/Empower/Amplify, the three stat boxes) when the browser viewport is at full width will stack vertically once the browser window is made narrower (elements will also be stacked vertically when viewed on a mobile device):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nas opposed to columns getting crunched when the browser window is made narrower:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI left figuring this out until the very end…mostly because I had no idea how to approach doing so. The Quarto documentation makes reference to Bootstrap’s CSS Grid and provides a simple, but clear example of creating columns in our Quarto doc. This helped me get started on a non-responsive 3-column layout, which looks like this:\n\n::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-4}\nleft-hand column content\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-4}\ncenter column content\n:::\n  \n::: {.g-col-4}\nright-hand column content\n:::  \n\n:::\n\nwhere {.g-col-4} defines the width of the column (Bootstrap’s grid system has a total of 12 columns across a page, so each of our 3 columns will be a width of 4).\nI got stuck for a long while after this point – the CSS Grid documentation makes it clear that this approach can be used to create responsive columns, but I found the provided example to be a bit confusing. After a lot of trial and error, and stumbling across this table that (sort of) makes reference to .g-col vs. .g-col-md classes from the CSS Grid documentation example, I eventually got myself some working responsive columns. While I still don’t fully understand it, this is my best attempt at explaining my working solution…here’s what it looks like:\n\n::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}\nleft-hand column content\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}\ncenter column content\n:::\n  \n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}\nright-hand column content\n:::  \n\n:::\n\n.g-col-12 represents the width of each column when the viewport is made smaller (e.g. either a narrow browser window or on a mobile device) – since the width of our browser is a total of 12 units, each column will take up the full width of the browser and be forced to stack vertically.\n.g-col-md-4 represents the width of each column when the viewport is made larger (e.g. a browser window that takes up a full laptop screen) – in this case, each column will only take up 4 units, or a third of the full width of the browser and can sit side-by-side one another.\nHere’s the above example in action:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, I used this approach for all pages that needed responsive columns (largely the landing page, but also the Our Team page and Resources page). If you end up finding this helpful in your own responsive web page journey – Yay!! If you have an alternative or improved solution, or if you understand these CSS grid classes more than I do, please do drop me a line – I’d love to hear all about it \n\n\nFavorite new thing(s) learned: mobile device previews and regex\nOkay, I couldn’t choose one, so here are my top two:\n\nPreviewing a web page for mobile device viewing: When building my own personal website, I always took the “let’s make changes, redeploy, then check it out on my phone to see how it looks” approach…which is never ideal. Huge shout out to my husband, Brendan Shanny, who showed me that you can preview a website as it would appear on a mobile device directly from Google Chrome. Right click on a web page > choose Inspect > click on the button with the laptop and phone icon in the top left corner of the Inspect pane to toggle between standard computer and mobile viewport sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView a web page as if on a mobile device by clicking on the laptop/phone button (circled in red) at the top of the Inspect pane.\n\n\nRegular expressions (regex) are really powerful: I’ve heard the terms “regular expressions” and “regex,” and I know they underlie some really powerful R packages (e.g. {stringr} for manipulating character strings), but I never really knew what they were or how to use them. Julie first introduced me to using regex during one late-night co-working session (she broke out her original copy of Practical Computing for Biologists, by Steven H. D. Haddock and Casey W. Dunn, which includes an excellent primer). Not more than a few days later, we realized we needed to reformat our redirects file, changing the way blog post URLs were represented from this:\n\n\n# Redirects from what the browser requests to what we serve\nblog/2021/03/10-nasa-announcement /blog/2021-03-10-nasa-announcement\nblog/2021/05/03-noaa-nwfsc-champions /blog/2021-05-03-noaa-nwfsc-champions\nblog/2022/02/17-esip-winter-2022 /blog/2022-02-17-esip-winter-2022\n\nto this:\n\n[[redirects]]\n  from = \"/blog/2021/03/10-nasa-announcement/\" \n  to = \"/blog/2021-03-10-nasa-announcement/\"\n  status = 301\n\n[[redirects]]\n  from = \"/blog/2021/05/03-noaa-nwfsc-champions/\" \n  to = \"/blog/2021-05-03-noaa-nwfsc-champions/\"\n  status = 301\n  \n[[redirects]]\n  from = \"/blog/2022/02/17-esip-winter-2022/\" \n  to = \"/blog/2022-02-17-esip-winter-2022/\"\n  status = 301\n\nUsing regular expressions (directly in RStudio!) to create patterns for matching, locating, and manipulating text allowed me to quickly reformat the 100+ redirects all at once. I documented my workflow in our redirects wiki.\n\n\nFavorite website feature: wikis\nMy favorite website feature is actually not a feature of the website itself (), but rather our GitHub Wiki for documenting conventions and workflows for current/future maintainers.\nWhile most of my notes initially ended up in GitHub Issues (e.g. page structure/styling conventions (issue #4), Using knitr::include_graphics() (issue #11)), wikis seemed to be a more organized solution for sharing these notes (and other important information) with those who will be maintaining and making changes to the website moving forward. Wiki articles range from creating and categorizing new blog posts to adding images to the website in a consistent way to an overview of styling the website using Sass & CSS.\nI’m honestly so jazzed about wikis at the moment and plan to start using them more to share project-specific information. Recently I created a wiki to provide setup instructions for workshop participants – in the past, I’ve linked a shared Google Doc in the repository’s README with similar setup information, which is effective, but harder to keep track of as a maintainer.\n\n\nMost valuable personal growth moment: overcoming imposter syndrome\nI’ve struggled with imposter syndrome throughout my professional career (as so many do!) – and it is hard to shake the feeling that I’m not qualified to be doing [fill in the blank with any one of the things that I get in my own head about]. This project was not one of those things. And I totally credit it to the supportive (and just generally fun) community that Julie and Stef create. It’s not easy to foster an honest no-such-thing-as-failing environment, but I really felt that way from the moment I got started (which says a lot, given that I’d be learning on the go for much of the project). I feel very lucky and honored that they trusted me with this work.\nThe Openscapes team certainly practices what they preach – you can read all about the Openscapes Approach for promoting psychological safety, kinder science, and a growth mindset, as well as explore the many other great resources developed by Openscapes.\n\nYou can check out the Openscapes website at https://openscapes.org/.

Learn more about her research at faculty.washington.edu/lbuckley.\n\n\n\n\n\nThermal art of the Getty Museum by one of Dr. Buckley’s research initiatives @trenchproject.\n\n\n\nI enjoyed interacting with the Openscapes and Ocean Health Index communities during a sabbatical visit to NCEAS. My lab is increasingly working on building computational and visualization tools for translating environmental change into organismal responses (trenchproject.github.io), so tools and best practices for open and reproducible science are increasingly essential. We have been working fairly independently and haphazardly to develop lab workflows and best practices over recent years so it was gratifying and empowering to find that our workflow linking GitHub, R Studio, and Google Drive and our use of other tools including slack and R Markdown closely aligns with the Openscapes recommendations (Lowndes et al. 2017; Lowndes et al. 2019).\nInteracting with the Openscapes team has facilitated a sabbatical goal of updating our lab documentation. We previously stored our workflow and best practices documentation on an internal webpage, but I was inspired by the Openscapes recommendations to move our materials to a GitHub “how_we_work” repository. I reformatted some of our existing resources as an onboarding document and adapted text from the Pinsky Lab (which was itself adapted from others in the Openscapes champions program) as an offboarding document. The offboarding document made me realize we need to do a better job of updating our README files once projects are completed. I aim for my lab to better inventory and describe each code and documentation file and to update the files with publication information. I hope the GitHub repository will lead to greater lab engagement with the materials and it will be nice to track changes over time. Suggestions for improving our materials are welcome and adapting them is encouraged!\nSome future goals for our lab based on the Openscapes resources:\n\nIncrease use of GitHub issues to track collaborative tasks, particularly for an R package we are developing.\nHold more “Seaside Chats” discussions on data and best practices.\nMore broadly, work on building lab community around open environmental data science.\nEnsure our how_we_work materials are updated and adapted for the diverse needs and backgrounds of lab members.\nEngage more with the environmental open science community via Twitter.\nAnd the perpetual goal of better documenting code and README files.\n\nThank you Openscapes and I look forward to continued interactions with the growing open environmental data science community."

    "section": "",
    "text": "“I was blown away at how effectively and productively you’ve led a virtual meeting – and I’m in a lot these days. People can be pretty passive”.\n\n\nThis quote from a participant really captures what we were hoping to achieve in our first remote support module, “Efficient virtual collaboration & facilitation for synthesis science.” We wanted to not only discuss strategies for efficient collaboration and engage participants hands-on, but also model the behavior we were teaching. The way we designed, led, and executed this workshop was just as important as the content.\n\nCrossposted at NCEAS\nThe National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) funds Working Groups of 15-20 scientists from across disciplines and sectors to collaborate on environmental synthesis science projects. In this time of pandemic, groups that would typically be meeting in person four times over ~two years are now faced with launching their projects virtually. NCEAS is providing training and support to help those teams kickstart their research collaborations remotely, and Openscapes was heavily involved in designing and leading the two remote learning modules. In this blog we highlight some of the key takeaways and best practices from our first remote support module, delivered to a cohort of four Working Groups that are launching projects this spring.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe welcomed participants to engage “hands on” and “faces on” by having Google Docs and Zoom side-by-side. Having both verbal and non-verbal communication channels made it more efficient for folks to share their thoughts, even in a larger group. Additionally, having specified time for silent Google Doc-ing allowed for rapid input from all twenty or so participants, as well as interaction as they commented on each other’s contributions or wrote +1 to say “me too”.\n\n\n\nAll aspects of the workshop were designed to reflect and enhance a few core principles that underpin effective remote collaboration:\n\nPrioritize access and equitable participation\nEmploy thoughtful, supportive facilitation (and use a team facilitation approach)\nCreate opportunities for horizontal (aka shared) leadership\nInvite interaction, and collaboration, and connection\nProvide multiple channels for collaboration and communication (visual and auditory, verbal and written, formal and informal, synchronous and asynchronous)\nFocus on what’s most important and use people’s time well\n\nOur rule of thumb for adapting to the virtual setting is: Keep it accessible, efficient, interactive, and connecting!\n\n\n\n\nWe shared our slides via Google Slides and had participants open them on their own machine as we presented, which provided an additional way to engage hands-on. This way participants could advance the slides at their own pace and control their size. We prefer this technique over screen sharing because it engages participants, takes less bandwidth, and provides a better viewing experience.\n\n\n\nThe structure of the workshop followed tips for leading remote events that we learned from Mozilla, and followed this example agenda that participants contributed to throughout the workshop. Participants highlighted the value of specific practices:\n\nUsing Zoom and Google-docs side-by-side engages participants through both verbal and non-verbal communication channels, making it easier for folks to share their thoughts, even in a large group. Zoom’s chat function provides a third, informal channel for participation.\nZoom’s Breakout Rooms create a space for small group interactions where everyone gets a chance to speak. Breakout group prompts and activities help participants make progress towards shared goals before reconvening and reporting out to the larger group. In our workshop, we first used breakout rooms to allow Working Groups to work on tasks within their teams; later in the workshop, we randomly mixed across Working Groups to create opportunities for learning and exchange to strengthen the NCEAS community more broadly.\nSharing slides ahead of time via Google Slides and having participants advance slides at their own pace instead of screen sharing gave participants an additional way to engage hands-on and reduced bandwidth problems.\nTime for silent “Google-docing”, reading others’ responses, and writing “+1” to say “me too” in response to a prompt was a way to hear all voices and see what resonated with everyone.\n\n\nSharing guidance from NCEAS’ 25 years of experience supporting open science and collaboration for synthesis science teams, we challenged participants to begin to lay out a pathway for successful remote collaboration for their teams. As they considered how to design upcoming virtual meetings, they reflected on Sam Kaner’s Diamond Model of Participation and best practices for cultivating divergent thinking and new ideas, navigating the messy middle where it can seem like the ideas will never converge (aka the Groan Zone), and then finally deciding upon a creative solution. More broadly, we encouraged participants to start developing a plan for supercharging all aspects of their collaboration by bringing in the Openscapes mindset, which harnesses the power of open data science and teamwork. We are excited to see what they do with these tools!\nThis was the first of two remote support modules for our synthesis Working Groups to help them to start their collaboration virtually in the face of the pandemic. The second module, “Tools and practices for collaborative, reproducible data science” will take place on May 8 and focus on helping scientists from the LTER network and SNAPP to develop reproducible analytical workflows as a distributed team. We hope to offer this kind of virtual training and support to more groups within and beyond NCEAS; contact Deputy Director, Courtney Scarborough if you are interested in future offerings. And, if you are interested in ongoing support of this kind, check out the resources offered on the NCEAS Learning Hub, including the Openscapes Remote Mentorship program."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introducing Openscapes\nThis article was originally published on medium.com\nI wrote this blog in preparation for MozFest — Mozilla’s annual festival for the open internet — October 2018, in London. I am a Mozilla Fellow, and I presented the idea of Openscapes, which will help increase the value of open practices within environmental science by engaging, empowering, and amplifying individuals.\n\nAs you know, we are currently facing some of the biggest environmental challenges of our time. Our food and freshwater systems are threatened by drought and pollution, climate change is producing more frequent and severe wildfires and hurricanes, and we are only just realizing the ubiquity and impacts of plastics in oceans and animals.\nYou might also know that there are incredibly talented scientists tackling these challenges. We are biologists, ecologists, climatologists, parasitologists, physiologists, geneticists, and many other -ists. Our research is on vastly different ecosystems, scales, and organisms, from uncovering how tiny high-alpine frogs keep our freshwater sources clean to modeling how global sea-level rise will affect seafood over the next century. While the scope of our work differs greatly, we all have one thing in common: we use data to help us understand and solve environmental problems.\nWhat you might not know is that there is a huge unspoken bottleneck slowing down our research: we rarely have formal training in computing, coding, or collaborative practices, which means we can be quite inefficient when it comes to working with data. We are constantly reinventing the wheels of data wrangling and analysis, which slows collaboration, communication, and action about these critical topics.\nBut there is a solution, and it is about openness and connecting scientists to existing resources. You see, open tools already exist, as do the growing communities of friendly, welcoming people who are building, using, and teaching these tools. These open tools and communities are powerful and empowering, and they are game-changing for science. And although there have been some scientists who have been early adopters — myself included, we now need dedicated efforts to welcome more scientists to use open tools and join communities of practice. This is the focus of my Mozilla Fellowship. I am excited to tell you about Openscapes, which is my plan for opening up the culture of environmental science through open community, data, and code. But first let me tell you about the motivation and momentum for Openscapes, through my experience and through Star Wars analogies.\n\nA bit about me\nI am a marine biologist: For my PhD I spent time at sea and more time in front of my computer studying the behavior of Humboldt squid, which are incredible animals that can be as big as I am. And since 2013 I’ve been working to get more data-driven science into marine management around the world with a project called the Ocean Health Index. Both projects involved a volume and variety of data that I had never encountered before in all of my training as a biologist. As a result, my research was at first hindered by my skillset for data analysis and also by my mindset, because I was intimidated by coding, but knew I had to to do my science. I overcame my fears of coding and also engaged in open practices because of patient mentors, inclusive team members, and a welcoming online community.\nOpen practices have been so game-changing for me that I am stepping away from my doing own research and focusing on enabling others to incorporate open practices in their work. I’ve been inching this way over the last six years at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), building communities of practice and sharing our path to better science in less time. I have seen the incredible momentum and impact that communities like RStudio, rOpenSci, RLadies, The Carpentries, and Mozilla Study Groups can have — not only for skillbuilding, but for community building and change on the ground.\nCollaborative, open data science practices have really opened my mind to what is possible for science, and I want to accelerate this experience for other scientists so we can find solutions to environmental problems faster.\n\n\nStar Wars + Open Data Science\nWhen I talk about my experiences, I can’t help but think about Star Wars. When Luke crashed his plane on Dagobah, he could not solve his current problem (i.e., get his plane out of the swamp) with the skillsets he had. It was demoralizing. But, Yoda had a skillset that solved Luke’s problem in a way Luke never dreamed was possible: he used the Force. As Luke learned these skills from Yoda, he also changed his mindset — not only did his skills help him tackle his next challenges, but they broadened the scope of what he thought was possible and the challenges he tackled.\nSo that was me on Dagobah too, looking at my problem (i.e. data incoming at various volumes, varieties, and velocities) that I could not tackle with the skillsets I had. And not just me: scientists all over the world are on their own private Dagobahs, unable to tackle their problems alone. But, open data science practices are like the Force, allowing scientists like me to learn these skills and then tackle our current challenges in ways we never imagined — and broaden the scope of what we think is possible with our science. Importantly, not all of Luke’s allies were Jedis themselves; folks like Han and Chewie were hugely important community members even if they did not use the Force. This is true for science as well: there are many ways to value and enable open practices, and everyone has something to contribute.\nAnd like Luke, our biggest barriers to engagement as scientists can be being aware that better practices exist and having confidence in ourselves. And so what we need is to value open practices as a scientific community and to welcome scientists to engage.\n\n\nOpenscapes\nThis is where Openscapes comes in. Openscapes is the program I’m developing as a Mozilla Fellow, based at NCEAS. The mission is to increase the value and practice of open data science in environmental science by focusing on three things: 1) engaging researchers at scientific institutions around the world, 2) empowering them with existing open software and communities, and 3) amplifying their individual and cascading efforts and impact.\nAs part of Openscapes, I am developing a mentorship program that mentors early career researchers in leadership roles (faculty, lecturers, program managers, etc). Openscapes will help them become champions and enable open practices through their lab groups, their teaching, and their departments. It is modeled after the Mozilla Open Leaders program, which means it is done remotely, and it is scalable because mentees can become mentors for incoming cohorts while the operations and curriculum stay with a small core team.\nOpenscapes.org will (someday soon!) have an engaging homepage, empowering resources, and stories from the champions that describe where they started, what they did next and where they are now. Through Twitter, @openscapes will amplify successes (and challenges) and bridge communities. Openscapes.org and @openscapes will complement this blog to engage environmental science communities around open practices. The Champion program will likely be just one part of Openscapes, but I will save that for a future post.\nThe first cohort of Openscapes is beginning soon, please stay tuned!"

The main point was that we can normalize open science through addressing the analytical needs of research teams, and that we must fund people that are already working to make this happen and grow the open movement.\nIn developing those ideas throughout my talk, I also focused on how open science is a behavior that we can support researchers to practice, and that a critical part of open science is that it helps promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in modern science. Additionally, open leaders do jobs that aren’t currently valued in academia, and they are critical to helping normalize open science.\nI think that data science should play a bigger part in open science conversations; I have seen that data science and open science conversations often happen separately. But data analysis is a really critical place to focus efforts for open science, because working with data is something that all researchers do, and it starts early and extends throughout the research process. That means data analysis can make open science truly be a daily activity, something that isn’t the case when we think about open science mostly as publishing or other products/artifacts. Supporting researchers to learn open practices for data science — “open data science — empowers researchers by meeting their analytical needs and turns open science from an idea to a daily benefit. I have been defining open data science as the tooling and people enabling reproducible, transparent, inclusive practices for data analysis.\nAfter describing how open data science is powerful like the Force from Star Wars (see my slides with artwork by Allison Horst), I gave an real-life research example with the Ocean Health Index.\n\n\n\n\nMy slide about the Ocean Health Index and our path to better science in less time\n\n\n\nOur Ocean Health Index team found out the hard way that our default approaches to data analysis was not reproducible by even ourselves. Getting through this involved quite a reckoning, but when we got through it, we knew we had a story to tell.\nTwo big lessons coming out of the Ocean Health Index story was first that open science was a means of meeting our analytical needs. Open science was not a goal in itself, but a secret power that was unlocked through engaging with the open community. And the second is that the open habits we developed are enduring because they are built on trust and teamwork. These two things have been key design elements for Openscapes, which I founded last year with a fellowship from Mozilla.\n\n\n\n\nMy slide about Openscapes and how open means kinder science\n\n\n\nI built Openscapes to empower scientists with open data science, focusing on teams and community. We approach open science as a spectrum, a behavior change, and a movement. We use data analysis as an entryway to meet scientists where they are, and help develop new skillsets and mindsets but also focus on empowering them as leaders and champions for open science.\nThe main way we do this is through Openscapes Champions, which is a mentorship program for research teams. It’s remote-by-design & cohort-based, which enables community building across research teams and universities and develops skills for collaborating remotely. I’ve mentored 13 PIs and their team members so far from academia and government, and I have a waiting list of folks that want to participate.\nThe biggest impact is that research teams are working more openly together. They’ve been able to do this by reframing data analysis as a collaborative effort rather than an individual burden. And what we see from that is that students are able to participate in research faster, grant money is going further, and teams are co-creating norms that promote diversity, equity and inclusion, and emerging collaborations across research groups.\nAnd the biggest lesson is the power of teams for normalizing open science. When we talk about open science it’s often about participating publicly. But the truth is, when researchers aren’t working openly within their research group, it’s hard to expect them to work openly in the public sense. So focusing on empowering teams to feel confident collaborating openly together can really catalyze enduring change. And developing efficiencies and resilience within the research group is an immediate benefit to the research group, so there is motivation and incentive to participate and develop these habits with the right support.\nFinally, I focused on priorities for funding open science. I see supporting people as a huge unmet need.\n\n\n\n\nMy slide about priorities for funding open science: supporting people to lead and participate. Figure from theCenter for Open Science\n\n\n\nI really like this figure from Brian Nosek at the Center for Open Science that shows how to change a research culture (I first saw it in a talk by Karthik Ram). Thanks to so much of the efforts of folks at the NASEM Roundtable, we’ve made so much awesome progress to make open science possible, easy, rewarding, and required. Now we must support people to make it normative. We need to invest in the human infrastructure that will make this possible. I had two suggestions, following on the themes from my talk that are possible to do now:\nFirst: sponsor research teams to be trained and mentored by existing efforts. This means paying for seats so researchers can attend Hackweeks, Meetups, Carpentries workshops, Openscapes cohorts with their other research team members. The benefits are to help meet existing needs with existing programs, and it’s little cost, and we can do it now.\nSecond: pay the salary for open leaders who train and mentor research teams. We already exist in academia by various unofficial titles: we are trainers, mentors, research software engineers, community managers. We are often early career, on soft money, with no job security or career path. Creating jobs for us is the ultimate goal but what’s needed right now is to pay our salaries so we can continue doing our work. The benefits are that trainers can focus on training, which meets this critical need and increases continuity of services, and importantly it also reduces the burnout that comes when open leaders do this without full funding and causes them leave academia, which then further delays open science progress.\nMy last point at the end of my talk was that open leaders do jobs that aren’t currently valued in academia, and they are critical to helping normalize open science. And, we should expect more of them and be prepared to support them in salaried university roles in the future."

    "title": "Incentivizing Open Science",
    "section": "Ideas from the Toolkit",
    "text": "Ideas from the Toolkit\nThe NASEM Roundtable on Aligning Incentives for Open Science’s Toolkit is organized in several sections, including Primers that give high-level overviews of open sharing on topics like articles, code & software, data, and reporting; an Open Science Imperative Essay about the benefits of open science; and a Sending Signals Rubric with language for signaling open science at specific points of high leverage. Here are some thoughts I’ve discussed with Erin Robinson, who has been participating at the Roundtable convenings. She has already been using the Toolkit to guide research statements and reference letters, and we’re interested to bring these concepts to Openscapes Champions cohorts as well.\nOpen Science Imperative Essay. There was some language that really resonated for us:\n\n\n“Historically, academic research environments have incentivized competition between individual researchers, which stymies collaboration and leads to the hoarding of knowledge”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Open Science practices, in contrast to traditional models of knowledge production, emphasize that open, transparent, and collaborative research dissemination practices more properly balance collective, institutional, and individual benefits. Open Science represents a positive evolution of the research endeavor along three dimensions: Collaboration drives innovation with the potential for broad social impact; Greater efficiency and speed; Replicability enhances trust and research quality”\n\n\n\n\n\n“Fortunately, the values that underpin Open Science – such as inclusiveness, collaboration, social impact, and scientific literacy – are mutually reinforcing to the missions of the research institutions, agencies, and funding organizations that support scientific research. Forward- thinking organizations have already begun to implement incentives for Open Science practices that provide a model for others to follow, which have taken several forms including: creating supportive environments”\n\n\nThese quotes resonated because they are about Open Science practices that interplay with support and collaboration. It is critical to focus on open practices along with open products, which are more readily measurable and thus have gotten a lot of the attention. It is fantastic to see them in the stated up-front, as mutually reinforcing with the missions of research institutions. These ideas are central to Openscapes, where we help create supportive environments centered on data science that drive collaboration, innovation, and efficiency, which are all part of the daily practice and benefits of Open Science.\nSending Signals Rubric. This rubric has four stages to help identify participation in Open Science. It seems like it would be really useful for other usecases beyond the hiring and tenure instances that it was developed for. For example, Openscapes may be able to use it as short-term indicators to understand where participating teams begin (likely Stage 1 or 2) and where they are at the end of the program, and months later. Likely the most useful version in this usecase timescale will be the “other outputs version”, so that participants can get credit for sharing teaching materials, Codes of Conduct, presentation slides and recordings, etc.\nPrimers. The Primers are 1-2 page high-level overview of the what’s and how’s of open sharing. They are organized in a really helpful way, introducing topics like articles, software, and data through their relevance to the open ecosystem, considerations, approaches, and resourcing. A comment is that they do all focus on products rather than behaviors, with guidance centering on the logistics and auditing side of making these products open without mention of the training and support scientists need to create open products. For example, the code and software section assumes that researchers are writing code, and code that is written ways that can be easily run independently by others on their computers (with appropriate licensing, etc). But coding and working openly and responsibly with data analysis is rarely taught in universities, making training in data analysis an unmet need — something that is being perpetuated to future scientists because self-taught scientists don’t feel comfortable teaching computing practices to undergrads. So, as we continue discussing goalposts for Open Science we need to think about the support we’re providing for researchers to be able to successfully meet those goalposts.\nSupporting the people required to enable Open Science could be reflected in the Primers’ Resourcing sections in the Toolkit. Many of the Primers have a statement that say “Administrators may be concerned about how policy changes can create additional operational work to already busy staff.” Yes — there is a lot of work involved to help normalize Open Science, and it will take more people and new jobs. We cannot expect to have already busy staff squeeze this in — we need to support open leaders and champions with valued jobs to help make this happen. From a recent post on FORCE11’s blog by Kaitlyn Thaney:\n\n\n“An additional dimension to our work involves looking at the staffing and human infrastructure powering open technology development, maintenance, governance and stewardship. That volunteer labor and community engagement is often an invisible cost we gloss over in our estimations and recommendations, while also being a core pillar in this work.”\n\n\nFinally, something missing from the Toolkit is how Open Science efforts must promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. There were several speakers at the November 5 Roundtable that spoke about diversity and inclusion in open science, so hopefully there are plans to weave this prominently into the Toolkit as well. There are many fantastic resources available, including Mozilla’s Inclusion and Governance Checklist and Abigail Cabunoc Mayes’s work on Working open as a way to shift power. We have been incorporating these ideas into Openscapes since the start, since our Champions mentorship program is modeled after Abby’s Mozilla Open Leaders, and thus prioritizing diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging is reflected in our language, our mentoring and engagement, our publications and presentations, our grant proposals. There is a lot of opportunity for Open Science to include and empower diverse participation, and Openscapes is excited to help."

    "title": "Wins from the inaugural Champions cohort",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This article was originally published on medium.com\nLast month we concluded our inaugural cohort of Openscapes Champions, and have just completed posting their individual case studies of their accomplishments and momentum (see blogs over the last two weeks). This post will be an incomplete summary of their awesome accomplishments across all labs, but it is a start! And the most exciting thing is that this is just the beginning of their impact on the future of environmental open data science.\nFor more details on Openscapes see Introducing Openscapes and Introducing the Champions Program.\n\nOver the past five months, 22 environmental scientists from 7 laboratory research groups — faculty, lecturers, post docs, grad students, lab managers, technicians, teaching assistants — learned together as an online cohort and also worked together with their labs towards building an efficient, inclusive, open data science culture in their scientific work, and on modeling that behavior to their broader communities.\n\n\n\n\nInaugural Champions Cohort, via Zoom.\n\n\n\nIn ten online sessions, our discussions centered around software that streamlines collaborating with data (including R/RStudio, GitHub, and Google Docs), strategies for community learning in the lab and beyond (including rOpenSci, RLadies, and the Carpentries) and how to set a deliberate tone of openness and inclusivity in the lab (including establishing codes of conduct and building from Mozilla Open Leaders). You can see a summary of topics in this tweet thread and in the series itself (although it is as-yet incomplete — but you can view the slides!). What is so exciting is that all participants have achieved tangible achievements as individuals, as labs, and across labs. Everyone started from different places and experiences with data, coding, and software, and everyone and had full schedules of previous commitments & responsibilities and limited time to give — but everyone prioritized Openscapes as they could (even on our last call we still had 18 able to join!), and everyone made tangible progress.\nWe’ve seen mindset shifts and increases in skills & practice by individuals. And we have also seen cultural shifts in labs as a whole, and leadership & championing inside, outside, and across labs. It is exciting to think of how these steps will continue to flourish and also seed change in other situations. Here we’ll describe some of the steps we’ve seen.\n\n\n\n\n“This isn’t just about coding and GitHub, this is about changing how we do science” –— Malin Pinsky (Pinsky Lab)\n\n\nThe first thing Openscapes set out to do was to help participating scientists think of their own research laboratories as a team. (As scientists, we are trained to focus on what makes our science as unique, and it can be hard to think about commonalities across science, especially since that mindset can make data challenges indistinguishable and inseparable from science challenges [this was certainly my experience with my PhD work]).\nWe approached thinking of the lab as a team by trying to find common challenges and opportunities that everyone experienced, no matter their scientific question, study system, or methods of each individual. We started these conversations centered around data, and specifically: how do you communicate about and share data/analyses/results with the lab lead (i.e. faculty, lecturer, principal investigator)? As answers came back as a mix of Dropbox, email attachment, Google Drive, GitHub, Box, and local server, we started to talk about the benefits of narrowing the number of channels, first of all for the sake of sanity. And efficiency. But also: with a narrower set of channels, communication could also be streamlined and create a network for all lab members, rather than the lab lead being the central hub.\n\n\n“This program has honestly completely re-made how I think about my science.” –— Chelsea Wood (Wood Lab)\n\n\nBut this type of action requires not only shifts in software, but shifts in mindset. It is hard to get motivated to change the way you already work, and it’s hard to require someone else to change on your behalf. Some of the unsung challenges of science and data analysis are the in-between bits; interoperability between software, expectations and hand-offs between collaborators. And streamlining these interactions have big rewards. I like the way Jenny Bryan & Jim Hester describe this (in the context of file organization):\n\n\n“It’s like agreeing that we will all drive on the left or the right. A hallmark of civilization is following conventions that constrain your behavior a little, in the name of public safety” — Jenny Bryan & Jim Hester, What They Forgot to Teach You About R\n\n\nSo we discussed a lot about shared practices with lab members, which means thinking about what unites scientists as a team rather than strictly about what sets us apart with our research. These changes in individual mindset lead to strengthened community in the lab.\n\n\n\nIdentifying key software to be used in the lab is a good first step, but it also requires making sure everyone in the lab feels comfortable using it.\n::: {.blockquote-blue} > “Our lab was able to incorporate respectful lab culture and discussion of data analysis as a part of designing experiments, lab meetings and lab dialogue much more than before. The analysis of experimental data has become as important as experimental design and data collection.” — Jayasundara Lab Case Study\nLabs created GitHub Organizations, and helped lab members create GitHub accounts and get comfortable using them. The GitHub Organizations and Google Drives have repositories and folders that are private, but they are shared with other lab members, which is a huge win for open practices within the lab. Additionally, there are many public repositories, some with names like “how-we-work” that have shared protocols for data workflows, and documentation for onboarding and offboarding lab members. Onboarding and offboarding were big topics of discussion: it’s important that new lab members can get up to speed with lab norms quickly, and that their work and insight continues to be available to the lab when they move on.\n\n\n“Oh God [Openscapes has helped me save] so much time. It makes me sad to think about how inefficiently I was doing science before Openscapes. — end-series survey”\n\n\nParticipants also upskilled as individuals. Some created their first GitHub account, others became confident using one they had created previously but never really touched. They practiced using the Issues feature to coordinate lab conversations and practiced using Markdown for Issues and lab documents. Folks that were confident R coders tried out new packages from the tidyverse and rOpenSci. Coders that used the console tried out the RStudio IDE. Python coders tried out reticulate to collaborate with R coders in RMarkdown. Scripts were less frequently versioned with underscored_dates_and_initials and sent by email — instead, they started being shared on GitHub.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nShifts in individual mindsets, along with software to streamline collaboration, led to cultural shifts in the lab more broadly. Shifting culture does not happen overnight, but having Cohort Calls be a example of what open culture can look like was a big underlying goal of Openscapes. We used software like Zoom and Google Docs to facilitate real-time collaboration and connection as a full group and smaller break-out groups, and took notes, had side conversations, and shared resources with each other. Several labs now use Google Docs to take live note-taking during their own meetings, both at the lab-scale and one-on-one.\n\n\n“I feel so much better about my projects that use open data science than I do about my earlier projects…I’m now insisting that all of my students use open science methods and recommending the same to colleagues.” — end-series survey\n\n\nLabs also have stated, public Codes of Conduct posted on GitHub, where they put their values forward and set the example of how they do science (see post about RStudio::conf culture). This followed really honest conversations about why Codes of Conduct are important, and that they can be uncomfortable at first (“this feels a bit insulting, do you expect I won’t act appropriately?”). But, we also discussed how we want to be the change we want to see in science, starting with more inclusivity and creating safe spaces to work and learn together, and that includes having safe spaces to be vulnerable and to fail, and to keep going.\nAdditionally, to get comfortable and normalize discussing data workflows in the lab, Champions have been leading semi-weekly “Seaside Chats”. Discussion topics vary (and a more concrete set of recommendations is coming), but setting time aside to be able to ask data/code/workflow questions and establish a common vocabulary around it has had visible benefits. Seaside Chats also have the effect of strengthening the culture in the lab, encouraging peer-to-peer learning, and strengthening leadership skills.\n\n\n“The course was a ton of fun, and I really did learn a lot. You also motivated much of the lab outside [Openscapes] to adopt more open data science tools and practices too!” — Daniel Forest (Pinsky Lab)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen practices in the lab is key for creating happy scientists and creating a culture of efficient and reproducible innovation. But of course the point is for it not to stay in the lab, but to be seeded throughout science communities more broadly. There were great examples of this as well, with lab leads and lab members championing open data science and being leaders in many contexts. Some of my favorite examples include Seaside Chats an open invitation to others in the department, and both graduate students and faculty asking faculty committees for data science to be taught within their department.\n\n\n“Being able to engage in discussions that are laying the foundation not just for open data, but more inclusive practices in science is exciting and a privilege to be part of.” — end-series survey\n\n\nSpeaking of teaching data science within environmental science departments, Nina taught a new course at Cornell entirely from Wickham & Grolemund’s R for Data Science, and has another course in the works. And Allison at UCSB not only got all her course materials organized on GitHub, she built a beautiful website as well (using GitHub and Markdown/Jekyll): allisonhorst.github.io.\n\n\n“We will also be designing a new course for incoming graduate students that will introduce them to key open science tools, building to a large extend on the lessons from our own process. This course will connect closely with the mission of Openscapes!” — Therkildsen Lab Case Study\n\n\nOutside of their labs, Champions are joining and leading communities. At UCSB, Allison from the Horst Lab started #tidytuesday hacky hours and Halley from the Froehlich Lab and Adrian and Lily from the Stier Lab attended their first eco-data-science sessions. And the Pinsky Lab has helped initiate several efforts: Michelle has started the first RLadies chapter in New Jersey (and there are already 30 members signed up preceding their first event!) and Malin is helping students who want to start a coding club on campus.\n\n\n“I’ve reached out to people to encourage open data science and begin to build networks that encourage open data science” — series-end survey\n\n\nSomething that was really exciting was to see momentum and interactions across labs. Some examples are the Pinsky and Horst Labs: Michelle and Malin are planning to teach a new open data science course at Rutgers, using Allison’s course materials (allisonhorst.github.io). Another example is with the Froehlich, Wood, and Therkildsen Labs: they all have ongoing research about aquaculture (food systems, parasite effects, and genomics), and have some proposal ideas in the works.\n\n\n“Openscapes really helped introduce me to ways of introducing open data science to colleagues and communities and resources to point them toward.” — end-series survey\n\n\nAdditionally, they are being ambassadors & engaging with #rstats Twitter, sharing open science and #rstats resources with their scientific networks.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be compiling a more complete report of the Champions program as a whole, along with other wins, challenges, lessons learned, and next steps. Until then, there is a lot of additional information and stories in these posts:\n\nOpenscapes Champions incorporate open practices in their science\nOpenscapes summit reflections — becoming champions\nOpenscapes summit reflections 2 — Changing the way we do science\nStarting our #tidytuesday hacky hours\n\nAdditionally, there are case studies sharing accomplishments for each lab:\n\nWood Lab — ecology of parasites in marine and freshwater ecosystems\nHorst Lab — stats & data analysis for environmental science grad students\nJayasundara Lab — physiological and biochemical traits underlying organismal adaptation\nStier Lab — resilience of harvested ocean ecosystems\nPinsky Lab — global change ecology and evolution in the sea\nTherkildsen Lab — conservation genomics and molecular ecology\nFroehlich Lab — marine aquaculture & fisheries science lab studying global food systems and climate change\n\n\n\n“Thank you from the bottom of my heart for introducing these practices into my life! I’ve been working on a brand new analysis script using the here package and github so work in the future will be more streamlined and organized. The conversation is definitely only getting started.” –— end-series survey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am so proud of what all of the Openscapes Champions achieved! I had ambitious expectations but was truly blown away by every single one of these scientists: by their achievements, enthusiasm, generosity of time, and thoughtfulness with each other. Openscapes is not only about introducing tools, it’s about creating a lasting culture around those tools. Our cohort included scientists who are leaders in their fields but were by and large not engaged in open science. But they are now champions in the lab and beyond, and it’s just the beginning of their leadership and impact on the future of environmental open data science.\nAnd luckily, it’s just the beginning of Openscapes as well!\nOpenscapes has been possible because of a truly life-changing Fellowship from Mozilla, and incredible mentorship and support from many many folks at Mozilla, NCEAS, the open data science community, and the Champions themselves. Thank you all, so much. And while my Mozilla Fellowship concludes at the end of this month, I will be receiving some generous support to continue Openscapes and develop a plan to mentor future cohorts! I cannot tell you how excited I am to continue this work. Throughout the summer and fall I’ll continue writing blogs as I synthesize all the lessons learned into the Openscapes Report, Volume 1 (working title) (and which I will also share). More exciting things to come! Thanks for reading :)"

    "text": "We are researchers whose work was so profoundly improved because of the open science community that we are dedicating our careers to empowering others and growing the movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Openscapes story starts with file names like “data_analysis_final_v2b.xls” — you know the ones. It is a story about learning we’re not the only one feeling lonely and stuck with this kind of workflow, and empowered that there is a better way. It is a story about reimagining what’s possible when we modernize how we collaborate as part of the open movement.\nOpenscapes has been co-developed by Julia Lowndes and Erin Robinson, combining their expertise of open data science and open data stewardship, community and program building, teaching and coaching, as well as their lived experience as researchers. Together, they built the Openscapes as a value-based initiative that builds momentum like a flywheel and sustainably supports research teams with open science. With the Openscapes Champions flagship program and the first cohort of research teams, Openscapes was initially launched by Julia through a Mozilla Fellowship in 2018, following her own team’s path to better science in less time.\nErin joined in 2020 and together they created the Openscapes Mentors Framework that supports scaling Openscapes into a movement with the Openscapes mentor community. Openscapes mentors are people embedded in science organizations that learn to lead Openscapes Champions programs for their organization. This framework was developed through a NASA grant that Julia and Erin lead. Beyond NASA, the Mentors Framework has supported mentors at several other organizations like NOAA, and the California Water Boards.\nWe are excited to continue learning and iterating with the open movement towards kinder science for future us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn about our our team who are helping grow and improve Openscapes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapes is committed to providing a welcoming, safe, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone.\nWe expect all participants to adhere to our Code of Conduct, which was influenced and adapted from rOpenSci and Mozilla.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllison Horst creates original art for Openscapes. Formerly an artist in residence at NCEAS and Assistant Teaching Professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Allison now works as a Data Scientist Advocate at Observable. She is also one of the inaugural Openscapes Champions. Allison has a background in the fine arts, and in recent years, began creating digital open artwork for data science and statistics education – explore her Openscapes gallery, her stats illustrations and follow her on Twitter.\nSee all of Allison’s Openscapes artwork on the gallery page, including our logo, which represents open landscapes of possibility and the data within them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are funded through grants and contracts with our partners, which supports investment in our flywheel to iterate our initiatives and share stories through blogs and media. We are grateful for our funding partners and the broader open community that supports tooling, people, and communities.\nOpenscapes launched through funding from Mozilla, via an Open Science Fellowship awarded to Julia Stewart Lowndes.  Openscapes grew with funding from NASA Earthdata, via decades-long community building leadership by Erin Robinson. Early funders also include the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, who supported us to develop a strategic growth plan, and Code for Science and Society, who supported us to improve daily practices for how we work and teach to more bravely align with our values for diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Openscapes website was originally built by Julia Stewart Lowndes with RMarkdown’s blogdown using the same open data science workflows used for research. The website was rebuilt by Samantha Csik in spring 2023 with Quarto, a new open-source, scientific and technical publishing system the Openscapes community has used since its earliest days (see quarto blog posts)."

    "text": "Openscapes Champions is an open data science mentorship program for science teams.\n\n\nWe support researchers to reimagine data analysis & stewardship as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. We work with academic, government, and non-profit research teams who become part of the open science movement as Champions empowered with new skill-sets and mindsets for modern data-intensive science. Learn these Champions’ stories through our blog, media, as well as steps for you to supercharge your research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Champions Program Resources \n\n\nThe Openscapes Champions Lesson Series is our open source curriculum we use to teach Champions Cohorts, and you can use it too.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Openscapes at a glance, check out our overview slides.\nOpenscapes Champions is a multi-month program that is led remotely and designed to ignite incremental and sustainable change within research groups — and beyond. The program remotely convenes a cohort of science teams twice per month over two or four months for 1.5-hour video calls that we call Cohort Calls. This is not a workshop. The Champions program design is modeled after Mozilla Open Leaders, where small time requirements over longer time frames and participants focused on their existing work fosters incremental change, accountability, and community building within the realities of scientists’ busy schedules, varying expertise and needs.\nEach Cohort Call uses the Champions Lesson Series, which is an open curriculum originally based on what was instrumental in the Ocean Health Index (OHI) team’s path to better science in less time, and openly iterated as we experiment and learn. We start off each call with a reminder of our Code of Conduct and provide multiple channels for participation, including through silent contributions to the Google Doc Agenda, breakout groups, and full-group discussions. Each call closes with an efficiency tip and an inclusion tip to incorporate into daily practice.\nParticipants attend as teams, and come prepared for engaged participation as a whole cohort and within smaller breakout groups (as teams and mixed across teams). Discussions focus around collaborative mindsets, norms, and software to enable open, reproducible, inclusive research, introducing tools like R, tidyverse, RMarkdown, GitHub, Google Drive, and Twitter and practices from open source communities, inclusive design, psychological safely, facilitation techniques, and examples from specific research domains including the OHI and previous Champions. Teams intentionally have a mix of data/coding experience and responsibilities; there are no coding prerequisites to participate.\nOpenscapes Champions program is designed so that everyone can learn new approaches and make progress, no matter where they are starting from. Each team creates a Pathway document to start thinking about where they are now in terms of the tools and practices for reproducibility, collaboration, communication, and culture. Throughout the Cohort, teams develop their Pathway to help identify, prioritize and articulate their needs and next steps. Pathway progress from each team is presented in the final session, which helps participants practice articulating their data workflow plans and needs, and see similarities and allies across the cohort to continue on these paths together.\nWith Cohort Calls occurring twice monthly on alternating weeks, the time in between each session enables participants to reflect and practice new concepts of immediate value to their own work while the Openscapes team incorporates feedback and iterates to better support cohort needs. One way we suggest reinforcing this reflection and practice is through a regular practice of separate team data-workflow meetings (we call “Seaside Chats”) in the alternating weeks between cohort calls. This gives them an opportunity to share their learning with their broader team or collaborators, to work on their Pathways with their teams and identify, discuss norms around data and code management and inclusive onboarding practices, and identify things they want to learn together and things they can teach each other.\nThe remote- and cohort-nature of the program is designed to reinforce each other’s learnings and networks across participating teams, with the purpose of empowering folks with open data science, and strengthening mindsets and habits to make data workflows and team culture more efficient and resilient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore previous Openscapes Champions Cohorts to learn about these inspiring teams’ research and open data science momentum.\n\n\n“This program has honestly completely re-made how I think about my science. Openscapes is a supportive training course for moving your lab toward open science, that meets you where you are.” — Dr. Chelsea Wood, University of Washington\n\n\n\n\n“Openscapes has created a new way of thinking about merging empathy and science. That’s an invaluable gift to me.” — Dr. Halley Froehlich, University of California Santa Barbara\n\n\n\n\n“My group needs to collaborate better and [Openscapes] provided good exposure to tools and mindsets that facilitate open science.” — Lead at NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Openscapes Champions Lessons Series is the core curriculum that we use in the Champions Program. It is iterated openly, with the most recent version always available online. Each Chapter has associated slides used in Cohort Calls, which we cover in Cohort Calls.\nThe Lesson Series is originally framed around the the tools and practices critical to the OHI team’s path to better science in less time, with examples from the open source programming language R and R communities. However, the concepts are relevant no matter the programming language, and we continually invest in this curriculum to incorporate examples from other languages and communities as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Resources page has some resources meant to welcome environmental scientists who are newly onboarding to open data science. We also have a public Openscapes Zotero library linking publications, talks, and curricula. Our Openscapes GitHub Organization has pinned repositories of interest, including the teaching-learning-resources repo where we use Issues to jot down specific tools or learning resources for open, reproducible, inclusive science.\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about how research groups participate in our Frequently Asked Questions."

    "text": "The Openscapes Champions Program is not a typical training workshop for individuals. Through Openscapes cohorts, you focus on your own work with your team.\n\n\nAs Openscapes introduces modern concepts, tooling, and examples from your peers for collaborative open data science, your team focuses on where you are and where you want to go together.\nOne of the biggest benefits we hear from past Champions is that Openscapes helps them “find their team” by identifying common needs and solutions, which makes science feel less lonely. While teams do not require a shared project, teams should not be arbitrarily constructed. Teams should be colleagues who already interact around research and will continue to, for example a research lab or group.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a lot of flexibility in choosing your team for the Openscapes Champions program. We designed it with academic research groups in mind, to provide resilience where there is high turnover and folks might be struggling with similar challenges around data analysis while working on different projects. But we’re increasingly working with research groups of different kinds and needs! We expect a range of technical ability and training experience; most importantly is selecting folks that have interest in making daily practices more efficient and developing collaboration and leadership skills.\nTeams do not need to have a specific shared research project to participate. The idea is that by developing shared open data science habits within the research group, it will be easier to onboard new folks and offboard knowledge/data/code/etc when folks leave. And, as more and more research groups work this way, it can ease transitions between research groups (i.e. when students graduate and take a position with a different research group).\nThe Champions Program is structured for teams with the intent that research group leads (faculty, lecturers, program managers, etc) and members (students, post-docs, analysts, lab managers, etc.) participate as a team together. This is a strategy so that the lead does not necessarily have to be an expert/comfortable with open data science to enable their team to design open data science workflows. Group leads and members participate together so that:\n\neveryone sees and values what is possible with open data science\nleads enable members to invest time in learning skills and developing shared workflows as part of their jobs\nmembers have guidance, agency, and support to incorporate open data science concepts into their work\neveryone champions open data science and contributes to growing the community of practice within the research group, institution, and beyond, in whatever capacity their roles and circumstances (time limitations & responsibilities) allow.\n\nChoosing your team can be based on interests around data analysis and around leadership. There are no prerequisite skills to participate, just an interest to learn and contribute. The “homework” between Champions sessions and beyond is to meet with your full research group (beyond workshop participants, and optional for the lead) to establish shared workflows and habits within the research group.\n\n\nHow you define \"team\" is completely up to you and having one person be in the cohort and using in-between session \"seaside chats\" to bring back the information to another group is 100% fine. That is common in the cohorts. In my first Openscapes cohort, I was the only person from my project. My personal goal was to use the Openscapes structure to help a team that I am on figure out how to tackle some off-boarding tasks due to a retirement. During my second cohort, there were 2 team members in the cohort and 2 not in the cohort. We focused on standardizing our data to get ready for our GitHub served data package. For the 3rd cohort I am doing, 2⁄3 of our team is in the cohort as we start to get organized for a major revamp of our report into a reproducible workflow. - Eli Holmes (NOAA NWFSC, NMFS-Openscapes)\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, the idea is to help individuals within a research group see themselves as part of a team. With this team mindset, your most important collaborator is Future You. Working with Future You in mind helps you spend more time on answering awesome research questions rather than trying to make sense of data_analysis_finalv2b.xls. And a team mindset also includes Future Us in the research group, so that onboarding and offboarding is more efficient and so that participation in science can be more inclusive and equitable.\n\n\n\nYes; we do try to have everyone on the team attend all Cohort Calls – but know that sometimes that’s not possible. The Cohort Calls are synchronous: in 90 mins, we teach for ~30 and the rest of the time is you discussing and applying open data science ideas to your own work with your team, and learning from your fellow champions. All the lessons, slides, and also recordings are available if people have to miss, but everyone should sign up expecting to be at the Cohort Calls.\n\n\n\nIt’s important that team leads attend with their team. The Champions program is designed to reduce the burden for PIs in the long term and develop leadership within and across their teams. With this investment now, team leads and members will build resilient and enduring practices for their research group, even as that research group changes into the future. The idea is that together, the whole team sees what’s possible with open data science and builds confidence, ownership, and a shared pathway forward. Then it’s the entire team, not just the PI, who puts it to practice in between sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, the cohort does not need a shared project; each team will work on what they need to for their own research. Teams within a cohort do not need to be closely related, but having teams somewhat related is good for community building (i.e. environmental science or psychology).\n\n\n\nFrom our experiences so far think that ~8 teams with 4-5 participants per team (maximum of ~40 participants) is a good size so there is time for everyone to be engaged and contributing (and not feeling like a passive webinar). Also, having a good amount of members per team is really key to the whole model of Openscapes: we want to reduce the amount of burden for PIs to have to relay info to their research groups. Having more members participate as a team in the Openscapes program helps more team members feel agency to build resilient systems with less transmission time."

Topics cover every aspect of biology, from whole organisms to molecular biology. Julie and Ileana were selected and invited by grad students.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: At Openscapes, we believe open science can accelerate interoperable, data-driven solutions and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in research and beyond. Our main activity is mentoring environmental and Earth science teams in open science, and connecting and elevating them both through tech like R, Python, Quarto, and JupyterHubs and communities like RLadies, Black Women in Ecology Evolution, and Marine Science, Ladies of Landsat, and NASA. We’ll share stories and approaches about supporting open science as a daily practice – better science for future us – and welcome you to join the movement.\nJulia Stewart Lowndes, PhD, Director of Openscapes is a marine ecologist working at the intersection of actionable environmental science, data science, and open science. Julia’s main focus is mentoring teams to develop technical and leadership mindsets and skills for data-intensive research, grounded in climate solutions, inclusion, and kindness. She founded Openscapes in 2018 as a Mozilla Fellow and Senior Fellow at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), having earned her PhD from Stanford University in 2012 studying drivers and impacts of Humboldt squid in a changing climate.\nIleana Fenwick is a core Openscapes team member; she is an open science advocate and Marine Sciences Ph.D. Student at UNC Chapel Hill. Ileana’s research focuses on evaluating how marine communities respond to climate change and human impacts. Her work uses innovative quantitative methods to improve our ocean management outcomes. In addition to her research, Ileana is also a fierce advocate for HBCU engagement and equity in open science and marine science through her consulting and volunteer work.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{openscapes2023,\n  author = {Openscapes and Openscapes},\n  title = {Openscapes: Supporting Kinder Science for Future Us},\n  date = {2023-03-31},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nOpenscapes, and Openscapes. 2023. “Openscapes: Supporting Kinder\nScience for Future Us.” March 31, 2023."

In the Northeast, data flow from individual businesses and/or scientific samplers to the region’s scientific and management organizations. This web of information can be difficult to access as much of the content is confidential in its raw form. Further, many of the codes and systems used to store these data are poorly documented, and even routine analyses are not commonly shared among data users. Currently, FDD are therefore difficult to integrate into scientific advice for ecosystem based fisheries management. Analysts tend to be unfamiliar with the data or hesitant to explore their potential, and data can be viewed with skepticism rather than leveraged in new and innovative ways. There is a need to begin to provide access, documentation, and cultivate a community of practice that focuses on using these data to their full potential.\nThis opportunity is funded through NOAA Fisheries Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) and a grant from the Fisheries Information System Program through an award to UMass Dartmouth-SMAST through CINAR.

We know many like you have been looking for a lighter-weight way to get involved to support yourself and your colleagues. We've designed the Reflections Program to meet this need and be more accessible and affordable; a welcoming place to reflect and grow the open science movement.\nOpenscapes Reflections is a 3-week program May 8-26 2023 that is a light-weight way to reflect on your workflows and make goals going into summer. This program provides a space to reflect on your workflows and plan how open data science practices can improve your daily habits and fuel institutional culture change. This can mean moving away from workflows with folders full of files with names like \"analysis_final_2b.xlsx\" and redirecting that energy to the parts of your work you really care about.\n\nWe are hoping Reflections can be useful for colleagues who haven't been part of Openscapes cohorts so far, as well as returning folks who want some accountability and space to reflect on their workflows and plan how open data science practices can fuel institutional culture change. Registration is $95, with more details on this webpage. We intend to make this program accessible to anyone interested so Openscapes sponsorship is available through the form as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{openscapes2023,\n  author = {Openscapes and Openscapes},\n  title = {2023 {Reflections} {Program}},\n  date = {2023-05-08},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nOpenscapes, and Openscapes. 2023. “2023 Reflections\nProgram.” May 8, 2023."

Our main activity is mentoring environmental and Earth science teams in open science, and connecting and elevating these researchers both through tech like R, Python, Quarto, and JupyterHubs and communities like RLadies, Black Women in Ecology Evolution, and Marine Science, Ladies of Landsat, and NASA. We will share stories and approaches about open science as a daily practice – better science for future us – and welcome you to join the movement.\nJulia Stewart Lowndes, PhD, Director of Openscapes is a marine ecologist working at the intersection of actionable environmental science, data science, and open science. Julia's main focus is mentoring teams to develop technical and leadership mindsets and skills for data-intensive research, grounded in climate solutions, inclusion, and kindness. She founded Openscapes in 2018 as a Mozilla Fellow and Senior Fellow at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), having earned her PhD from Stanford University in 2012 studying drivers and impacts of Humboldt squid in a changing climate.\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{openscapes2023,\n  author = {Openscapes and Openscapes},\n  title = {WiDS {Stanford} 2023},\n  date = {2023-03-08},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nOpenscapes, and Openscapes. 2023. “WiDS Stanford 2023.”\nMarch 8, 2023."

    "text": "This is a professional development and leadership opportunity for ocean professionals to make data collaboration more systematic, sustainable, and responsible.\nOur increasingly datafied society provides exciting advances and at the same time has created new data asymmetries. Much of the data generated is not equally accessible to those who need it. Advancing access and reuse of data for public interest purposes requires data collaboratives - new partnership models where data is made accessible and reciprocated to generate insights that can help address societal challenges.\nCombining the expertise of The GovLab, and Openscapes, this Studio will help participants understand what data collaboratives are, and review their various manifestations; how to establish them in a methodological and purposeful manner; and to govern them in a responsible and effective way. The introduction will be accompanied by discussions to help participants build their skills and establish a community of practice with like-minded leaders around data collaboratives for the Blue Economy.\nThe GovLab, an action research center founded at New York University, works to deepen our understanding of how to govern more effectively and legitimately through technology.\nOpenscapes helps research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities.\nIntertidal Agency designs at the intersection of people and planet and serves as the PI for the National Science Foundation’s Convergence Accelerator grant that supports this work."

Julie Lowndes and Allison Horst will be co-presenting a keynote talk on June 5. There is a great lineup of speakers and we are excited to be a part of it!\nSlides available at openscapes.org/media.\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: Open science as a movement and the art of Openscapes\nAbstract: The open science movement is “a collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information and knowledge within the scientific community and the wider public to accelerate scientific research and understanding” (Ramachandran et al 2021). We’ve felt included in this movement through the #rstats community, and argue that data science is a powerful entryway to welcome researchers to open science – one that transforms open science from an aspirational idea to a tangible daily benefit for efficiency, reproducibility, and collaboration. We will share how Openscapes is helping to onboard more research teams to the open science movement, in part through artwork to represent and develop ideas to make open science more inclusive and kind.\nJulia Stewart Lowndes @juliesquid is a marine data scientist and Senior Fellow at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS). As founding director of Openscapes (created during her Mozilla Fellowship) she champions kinder, better science in less time and empowers science teams with skillsets and mindsets for open, reproducible research. She earned her PhD at Stanford University in 2012 studying drivers and impacts of Humboldt squid in a changing climate. She is a Carpentries instructor and co-founder of Eco-Data-Science and R-Ladies Santa Barbara.\nAllison Horst @allison_horst is an Assistant Teaching Professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara, where she has been teaching environmental data science, math and data analysis courses since 2012. Through her artwork, Allison illustrates data science concepts, R packages and functions, workflows and mindsets to welcome and support R learners, and was RStudio’s Artist-in-Residence from 2019 - 2020. She co-founded and is an active member of the UCSB TidyTuesday coding club and R-Ladies Santa Barbara. She has also created all artwork for Openscapes and was a mentee in the inaugural Champions Cohort!\n\n\n\nReusehttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/CitationBibTeX citation:@online{openscapes2021,\n  author = {Openscapes and CascadiaR},\n  title = {CascadiaR {Conference}},\n  date = {2021-06-05},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nOpenscapes, and CascadiaR. 2021. “CascadiaR Conference.”\nJune 5, 2021."

    "text": "Version 2.1, June 2022\n\n\n\nSupporting a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone in our community is paramount, as is strengthening connections with other communities that have influenced our work. Our Code of Conduct is heavily drawn from rOpenSci and Mozilla, who we greatly appreciate for their leadership in this area.\nOpenscapes is committed to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone.\nDiversity is our strength, we try to cultivate a tone where everyone in the community, no matter their backgrounds and accomplishments, comes with a mind open to learning from, with, and for each other. In this mindset, questions are always welcome and appropriate because they don’t expose the lack of knowledge of the asker. Rather, questions expose opportunities for clarification for the original communicator, and for further opening up the conversation to include different perspectives and learning styles.\nIn our community we encourage listening and empathy in all of our interactions. This means:\nBe Respectful\nValue each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.\nBe Direct but Professional\nWe are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.\nBe Inclusive\nSeek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.\nBe inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:\n\nRemote (on video or phone)\nNot native language speakers\nComing from a different culture, perspective, or background\nUsing pronouns other than “he” or “she”\nLiving in a different time zone\nFacing other challenges to participate\n\nIf you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back, encourage other voices to join in, and listen actively to them.\nUnderstand Different Perspectives\nOur goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.\nAppreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences\nWe come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ perspectives, contributions, and needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect everyone to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.\nLead by Example\nBy matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the highest good for our community.\n\n\n\nBe respectful, honest, inclusive, accommodating, appreciative, and open to learning from everyone else.\nDo not attack, demean, disrupt, harass, or threaten others or encourage such behavior.\nThis Code of Conduct applies to all people participating in the Openscapes community, including Openscapes staff and leadership. It applies to all modes of interaction online including GitHub project repositories, remote calls, and in person at Openscapes -hosted events.\n\n\n\nIf you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the organiser Julia Lowndes at openscapes @ nceas.ucsb.edu or independent community member Allison Horst at ahorst @ ucsb.edu with a description of what has occurred and any supporting information that would be helpful. After receiving a concise description of your situation, Julia or Allison will review the report and determine next steps. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.\n\nThe Openscapes Code of Conduct is heavily drawn from rOpenSci and Mozilla, who we greatly appreciate for their leadership in this area (see Mozilla’s inclusion repo. Additional resources influencing this document include Postit (formerly RStudio), Open Post Academics, and the groups described in open software means kinder science. Please also see the value and ethics statements from Ben Marwick’s lab as well as other inspiring examples from EpiEllie’s twitter thread and the coop at Fred Hutch."

This was a remote event series to welcome Black scientists to open data science and the first event had 80 people. She is part of the core Openscapes team and we are committed to lead this program annually. Eli has co-led dozens of learning events, including in Fall 2023 coordinating and co-leading 4 Openscapes cohorts for 160 NOAA staff across 6 science centers, the Office of Science and Technology and the West Coast Regional Office. She is increasingly involved in open science efforts within NOAA and across federal agencies.\nThese are examples of learners becoming leaders within and across institutions.\nLearn more:\n\nA Journey to Data Science: Tools for Equity and Diversity in STEM - July 28, 2022: Talk by Ileana Fenwick at RStudio Conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTODO: Separate.\nIleana Fenwick.

Both participated in Openscapes in 2021, as learners in the Champions Program. They learned what they needed to for their specific research needs:\nIleana learned how to code collaboratively in R. This meant writing code that others would see and be able to run on different computers. It also meant reusing other people’s code, and actually building relationships with the authors and asking them questions. She learned to use GitHub for collaboration and publishing. She has talked about how important Openscapes was for onboarding to her PhD program during COVID, since it connected her to others and made her feel less alone. Eli learned how to build spaces to have difficult conversations around succession planning. She’s a long time GitHub user, using it for version control. Through Openscapes she learned how to use Issues for project management collaboratively with her team, and she learned Quarto, a new open source technical publishing system developed by Posit.\nBut they’re not only learners, they are mentors and leaders —\n(video) - TODO Eli’s ESIP slides and video\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia page"

    "text": "Cross-posted from the Coiled blog. James Bourbeau is Lead OSS Engineer at Coiled, a company providing software and expertise for scalable Cloud computing built on Dask. Through the NASA Openscapes community, we support researchers using NASA Earthdata as they migrate their data analysis workflows to the Cloud. This Fall, Openscapes is partnering with Coiled to support us experimenting with another approach to Cloud access.\nAmy Steiker, Luis Lopez, and Andy Barrett from NSIDC and Aronne Merrelli from the University of Michigan shared their scientific use cases which motivated this post.\nWe show how to run existing NASA data workflows on the cloud, in parallel, with minimal code changes using Coiled. We also discuss cost optimization.\nPeople often run the same function over many files in cloud storage. This looks something like the following:\nThis straightforward but important pattern occurs frequently in groups working with NASA Earthdata and NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) to move scientific workloads to the cloud. Here are some examples:\nIn this post we’ll show how to run this same “function on many files” analysis pattern on the cloud with Coiled, which you can copy and modify for your own use case. We’ll also highlight cost optimization strategies for processing terabyte-scale data for fractions of a dollar."

Here are some examples:\n\nExtract greenhouse gasses over urban areas from TROPOMI L2 data: TROPOMI measures trace gasses and aerosols relevant for air quality and climate. It generates a large volume of L2 data stored as millions of files on S3. In our particular project we’re interested in greenhouses over highly populated urban areas, and how they affect quality of life. We need to select those files over many cities and then construct a timeseries over them to see how air quality changes.\nGrid sea ice freeboard data from NASA’s ICESat-2 mission: This workflow from NSIDC researchers loads L3 sea ice freeboard HDF5 data, selects a lat-lon bounding box of interest, and regrids the dataset to the EASE-Grid v2 6.25 km projected grid using drop-in-the-bucket resampling. The resulting processed dataset is then written out to a local Parquet file to be used in further analysis. This is particularly valuable as it allows researchers to easily create their own specialized datasets with spatial and temporal resolutions relevant for their analysis.\n\nIn this post we’ll show how to run this same “function on many files” analysis pattern on the cloud with Coiled, which you can copy and modify for your own use case. We’ll also highlight cost optimization strategies for processing terabyte-scale data for fractions of a dollar.\n\n\n\n\nComparing cost and duration between running the same workflow locally on a laptop (data egress costs), running on AWS, and running with cost optimizations on AWS."

    "text": "Processing on the Cloud with Coiled\nLet’s run the exact same analysis on the cloud. Running on the cloud helps in a couple of ways:\n\nData Proximate Computing: Running computations closer to where the data is stored increases performance and avoids data transfer costs.\nScale: Distributing the processing over many machines in parallel lets us tackle larger volumes.\n\nUsing Coiled to run the same workflow on the cloud involves lightly annotating our process function with the @coiled.function decorator:\nimport coiled\n\n@coiled.function(\n    region=\"us-west-2\",                  # Run in the same region as data\n    environ=earthaccess.auth_environ(),  # Forward Earthdata auth to cloud VMs\n)\ndef process(granule):\n    # Keep everything inside the function the same\n    ...\nThis tells Coiled to run our processing function on a VM in AWS and then return the result back to our local machine.\nAdditionally, we switch to using the Coiled Function .map() method (similar to Python’s builtin map function) to run our process function across all the input files in parallel:\n# Step 3: Run function on each file in a loop\n# results = []\n# for granule in granules:\n#    result = process(granule)\n#    results.append(result)\nresults = process.map(granules)     # This runs on the cloud in parallel\nWith these two small code changes, the same data processing runs in parallel across many VMs on AWS. The runtime drops to ~9 minutes (a factor of ~42x speedup) and costs ~$1.52 (a factor ~16x less)."

This demonstrated the following:\n\nEasy: Minimal code changes to migrate existing code to run on the cloud.\nFast: Acceleration of the workflow runtime by ~42x.\nCheap: Cost reduction of ~70x.\n\nWe hope this post shows that with just a handful of lines of code you can migrate your data workflow to the cloud in a straightforward manner. We also hope it provides a template you can copy and adapt for your own analysis use case.\n\n\n\n\nComparing cost and duration between running the same workflow locally on a laptop (data egress costs), running on AWS, and running with cost optimizations on AWS.\n\n\n\nWant to run this example yourself?\n\nGet started with Coiled for free at coiled.io/start. This example runs comfortably within the free tier.\nCopy and paste the code snippet above.\n\nGoing to AGU 2023? Come by the Coiled booth and say hi (right by the entrance next to Google)."
