# Build communities

Openscapes is built with the idea that we can model the open culture we want in science. It starts with making open data science more visible and valued in our communities. So what can you do? All of the following involve seeking out opportunities to engage and learn, including others, and amplifying your efforts. 

- read publications about open data science in academia in journal clubs. Examples:
  - [Lowndes et al. 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)
  - [Stevens et al. 2018](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/11/265421)
  - [list of many others](http://ohi-science.org/news/importance-of-open-data-science-tools)
- include open data science in your talks or publications
- ask your department for a [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) workshop
- ask your department to offer data science courses
- join or [start a coding club](/blog/2018/11/16/how-to-start-a-coding-club/)
- join online communities and find allies. Recommended: 
    - [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/)
    - [RStudio](https://community.rstudio.com/)
    - [RLadies](https://rladies.org)
    
<!--- - [use Twitter for science]() --->

And if you are in a leadership role, in addition to all the above:

- talk about open data science in your departments and faculty meetings
- teach a course (you can use [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and learn as you go, as one of our Champions as done!)
- include funding for open data science in grant proposals
- give your students time and space to learn
- send your students to conferences like [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) and [useR](http://user2019.r-project.org/) 
- support your students starting a coding club on campus
- support your lab having "data workflow" lab meetings (the Ocean Health Index calls these "seaside chats")
