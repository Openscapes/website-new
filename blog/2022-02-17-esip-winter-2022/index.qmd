*At the ESIP Winter Meeting, "Data for All People: From Data Generation to Data Use and Understanding", we held a session called "[Better Science for Future Us: Planning for the Year of Open Science](https://2022esipjanuarymeeting.sched.com/event/qkp5/better-science-for-future-us-planning-for-the-year-of-open-science)", with speakers from University of North Carolina (UNC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries, California Water Boards, University of Colorado, and United States Geological Survey (USGS). The goals of this session were to increase visibility and value of open science within government and support researchers and leaders that are already doing this within government organizations; to create more channels for inter- and cross-agency learning; and to share open science stories across agencies as we prepare for NASA's [Year of Open Science](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science) initiative. Speakers shared stories about open science in government and their experiences with Openscapes. These examples were shared in a "Fishbowl" format, where speakers each shared and then there was a broader discussion with the 70+ participants.*

## 3 takeaways for planning for the year of open science

Our ESIP session provided space to bring four different groups together
who are working with Openscapes so that they could share their stories
and discuss their implementation of open science practices with a
broader audience of allies. These folks are "early adopters" who are
investing the time and effort needed to help colleagues transition to
open science. This session aimed to increase the visibility of open
science within government, support open science leaders within
government organizations, and create more channels for inter- and
cross-agency learning.

  
A strong theme throughout the whole session was equity. Ileana Fenwick
underscored how open science has not been accessible to everyone in
science and discussed her ongoing work to build equitable pathways for
researchers at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and
the importance of providing support and aftercare. Eli Holmes described
how equity must become a focus within NOAA as well; while some science
centers have had a high density of early adopters and lots of resources
including code sharing and peer mentors, other centers or labs have had
fewer early adopters or their coders have not been connected to the
others. Anna Holder's work at the California Water Boards centers
equity. Anna sees the true spirit of open science as being at the nexus
of open data and science; effective science communication; and equity,
specifically centered around racial equity and environmental justice.

Here are 3 overlapping takeaways from this session that all speakers
embodied. We describe these more fully below.

-   Both top-down and grassroots efforts are necessary

-   Dissolve silos by supporting early adopters

-   Reuse and build from existing efforts to accelerate change

<br>

## Both top-down and grassroots efforts are necessary

Both top-down and grassroots efforts supporting open science are
necessary - and need open and active communication channels. Our session
started off framing [NASA-Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io)
as "top-down" since NASA's Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) leadership
supports open science through official policy and initiatives (see the
[2021 NASA ESDS Program
Highlights](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/2021-esds-highlights)), and
framing efforts at NOAA Fisheries as "grassroots" as early adopter
researchers find each other and join forces to make the case for open
science to leadership.

But as we talked, the importance of and need for both really came
through.

When Amy Steiker and Aaron Friesz, from NASA's Distributed Active
Archive Centers (DAACs), discussed their work with NASA Openscapes, Amy
mentioned that while there is critical top-down support from NASA
leadership, managers look to researchers at the grassroots level to
determine what open science can look like. Additionally, NASA staff have
been asking for open source tooling and workflows to support
researchers, including JupyterHubs where they can develop open source
code on the Cloud. Now as Aaron, Amy, and colleagues have access to a
JupyterHub to develop and teach tutorials for NASA Earthdata (like they
did at the [2021 Cloud
Hackathon](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Hackathon/)),
they are able to share progress and lessons learned, and get feedback
and support from their NASA teams, managers, and leadership. So, while
from the outside this might look strictly top-down, NASA is a really
exciting example of how both are needed and how creating channels for
them to listen and iterate together is really key.

<br>

## Dissolve silos by supporting early adopters

Silos within organizations can be dissolved by supporting early adopters
that already exist. Eli Holmes introduced open science early adopters as
part of the [diffusion of
innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations)
theory, that there is a predictable progression of stages as an idea
diffuses through a population or organization (see image below). Early
adopters play a critical role in not only uptake of new ideas and
technologies like open science, but also in championing and
communicating the vision of what is possible to reach leadership, who
are part of the majority and key to organization-wide decision making,
policies, and culture. She described the spread of open science and open
source workflows at NOAA Fisheries and how early adopters do exist but
tend to be siloed and can have trouble finding each other - in part due
to lack of communication channels like email lists or cross-program
technical groups. In a grassroots fashion, Eli and colleagues have
created the [NOAA Fisheries
Openscapes](https://github.com/nmfs-openscapes) GitHub organization as a
place to share analytical and teaching resources for scientists across
the agency, support open science communities such as the agency R User
Group and RStudio Connect community, and build visibility for open
science work already going on at NOAA Fisheries.

be isolated.*

Anna Holder said of the California Water Boards, "like many complex
organizations, we too have complex data systems and infrastructure". She
described their open data journey and how this has been part of their
organizational fabric for over five years. In addition to official
strategies, communication and teaching with different audiences within
the organization has been key. Anna and colleagues are leading "data
literacy" workshops for executives --- not to teach tools like R and
GitHub but to discuss that these tools exist and showing use cases that
make their staff more efficient, for example where data quality control
can be done in minutes rather than weeks. This work often involves
"slowing down in order to speed up", and underscores not only the
importance of early adopters but the role early adopters play in
teaching and supporting colleagues as whole organizations transition to
open science.

It is critical to recognize that early adopters already exist. They are
bright spots that get brighter when working together and collectively
spread more brightness within an organization, like Anna's work at the
Water Boards, Eli's work at NOAA Fisheries, Aaron and Amy's work within
NASA, or Ileana's cross- organization work with HBCUs. This follows the
point above that grassroots efforts are critical for building these
communities and helping identify needs.

<br>

## Reuse and build from existing efforts to accelerate change

Why is the Openscapes approach working? There have been many preceding
and ongoing efforts, so what's different here? This came up several
times in the session live notes and we did not have much time to
discuss, so we debriefed with the speakers and NASA Openscapes Mentors
afterwards and have some emerging thoughts to share. We are all building
off years of work by many in the open science community and beyond and
are so grateful for those ongoing efforts.

A critical part is creating "space and place". One of the key things
that we do is to create space for cohorts of researchers and mentors to
talk, build community, and find common needs (which also takes time and
consistency).  Then a place is needed to collaborate, which means using
technology like Google Docs, GitHub, Slack, as well as JupyterHubs, and
RStudio, depending on community norms. For the NASA Openscapes Cohort,
having our 2i2c JupyterHub has been really critical; for many it has
been their first exposure to the Cloud, and since they now have hands-on
experience they can better support researchers who are using it too. In
Ileana, Eli, and Anna's work in marine and aquatic science, RStudio is a
shared environment to work together because shared workflows, for
example with RMarkdown, enable shared approaches to communicate with
different audiences.

Another part is that we can reuse and build from what already works.
Aaron Friesz described the benefit of being able to "peer over the wall"
to see and compare what types of strategies and resources other NASA
DAACs have explored. This then enables Mentors and their colleagues at
other NASA data centers to incorporate and reuse what was working
elsewhere, rather than all reinventing in their own silos. This can mean
reusing code as well as reusing communication channel setup for
different communities; for example several data centers are re-using the
2021 Cloud Hackathon book structure and facilitation as well as the
lessons in upcoming workshops. There is so much previous, ongoing, and
accelerating work that has been developed as part of the open movement
that we can leverage --- meaning technology, material, and the ability
to work together. 

Finally, a large part is the time investment, i.e. having time for open
science as part of paid jobs. Creating "space and place" takes time. It
is really important to recognize that all speakers have been given time,
resources, and support by their supervisors. This has been particularly
important for NASA Openscapes, where Managers at the DAACs have approved
dedicating up to 80% of weekly time to open science to support learning
through Carpentries Instructor Training and Openscapes Cohort Calls;
Co-Working, and Clinics; developing, reviewing, and getting teaching
feedback in "dry runs"; and teaching at Cloud Hackathons and workshops
(see [NASA Cloud
tutorials](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/tutorials.html)).

## Onward

Our team was very inspired by this session, including all of the
comments and questions from both the speakers and the audience.
Equitable access to open science will continue to drive our shared work
going forward and we are excited for what's to come.
