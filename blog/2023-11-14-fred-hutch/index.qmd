*In Fall 2023, Openscapes ran our first ever Champions Cohort for research labs in the [Fred Hutch Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/), in collaboration with the Fred Hutch Data Science Lab ([DaSL](https://hutchdatascience.org/)).*

The inaugural Fred Hutch Openscapes Cohort took place over 5 virtual sessions  from August 29 to October 24, 2023. Cohort calls focused on 1) working towards a common understanding of the Openscapes mindset and considering what a pathway forward looks like for your team. ([Call 1 digest](https://github.com/Openscapes/2023-fred-hutch/issues/1)), 2) publishing and project management on [GitHub](https://github.com/nmfs-openscapes/2022-noaa-afsc-fall) ([Call 2 digest](https://github.com/Openscapes/2023-fred-hutch/issues/10)), 3) nurturing team culture and data strategies for future us ([Call 3 digest](https://github.com/Openscapes/2023-fred-hutch/issues/11)), 4) participating in open science communities and coding strategies for future us ([Call 4 digest](https://github.com/Openscapes/2023-fred-hutch/issues/12)), and 5) sharing each team's path forward as they continue their open science journeys ([Call 5 digest](https://github.com/Openscapes/2023-fred-hutch/issues/13)). 

## The Teams

**The Berger Lab** 
Alice talked through the team’s Pathway sheet (linked in the doc). Sita put an example analysis in a GitHub repo shared with the lab for the first time. She’s done this so others can reuse or adapt the code and have an example to follow for more open practice. Open doesn’t have to mean fully public; it can be private to Fred Hutch, or even just your lab. Daniel was inspired to use GitHub Issues and screenshared a checklist for the week with people’s replies. This led to a discussion of Issue templates and other recurrent processes they could use a checklist or template for. Monica shared a package she made with basic analysis templates for different immunoassays and she’s working on more of these for DaSL’s work.

**The Ha Lab** 
Thomas raised the challenges of version control and code sharing when changes made downstream are not pushed back to the main GitHub repo. Monica noted that slowing down to speed up is key here; behavior change takes time and care but the benefits are huge. Patty screenshared her use of the project management tool Jira (supported by Fred Hutch). It requires upfront infrastructure development, but it’s worth it. She is piloting Starfish, a software application for unstructured data management, for viewing all your files, tagging them with metadata or actions like ‘moved to S3, and for visualizations of file sizes and counts. Adil brought up something that the other groups see as a common need: how to keep track of papers with useful looking data and then find them later when you actually need them.

**The Setty Lab** 
Cailin and Sarah co-presented to share their plans in categories: Lab wish list; Community involvement; Data sharing; Promote DEI, identified next steps in each and how they’re making progress. They’d like to switch to VS Code as it has better integration with GitHub and they want to use Copilot. Sarah wrote a script to make setting it up smooth for people. They plan to start a once a month meet up to do something that’s related to work but that’s not the usual data science discussion. Examples are listening to a podcast and discussing, or learning about techniques for giving feedback. They prompted a good discussion of using Notion that revealed expertise and willingness to share across the labs and DaSL.

**DaSL**
Sean wants people to stay in touch! With each other and with DaSL. He shared many ways to continue to connect with DaSL. The newsletter is where they post all educational offerings like this one. He shared links for bookable Data House Calls for code, GitHub, and data management questions or issues, and Monica holds Data Analysis/Stats and Clinical Data House Calls. Sean even offered 1:1 coworking time to folks in this Cohort! Such rich opportunities to get direct engaged support. Links for booking are in our Agenda doc. Monica has started hosting Lakeside Chats for discussions and coworking! She’s been forking Openscapes practices for the win - like reusing our agenda doc structure and collaborative note taking. In response to the interest in Notion, Monica screenshared how she uses it for Agendas and Notes for Our Connections Points. She’s got templates for different meeting types to save time and minimize errors that can come from manual re-typing.

## Conclusion

On ramp. This is just the start. Seeing what's possible.
