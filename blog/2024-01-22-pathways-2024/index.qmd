We're thrilled and grateful to announce our 2024 offering of Pathways to Open Science! This is an ongoing collaboration with [Black in Marine Science (BIMS)](https://www.blackinmarinescience.org/), [Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science (BWEEMS)](https://www.bweems.org/), and HBCU marine science professors led by Ileana Fenwick, with Alex Davis, PhD, and Aneese Williams. Thanks to new funding from the [Mozilla Foundation's Alumni Connection grants](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/mozilla-announces-first-ever-alumni-connection-grant-finalists/), the Openscapes team is excited to collaborate with [PREreview](https://prereview.org/) and Antoinette Foster, PhD to bring expertise in values-guided career navigation and anti-racist scholarly review to the programming this year. Pathways to Open Science is a free remote event series for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science.

The series kicks off January 25th with six events weekly on Thursdays alternating between Community Calls to learn from speakers and Coworking for folks to bring their own work, code, or questions and learn new skills together (details on the [website](https://openscapes.github.io/pathways-to-open-science/#program-details)). Presenters include LaTreese Denson, PhD (NOAA Fisheries), Dawn Wright, PhD (ESRI), Justin Rice, PhD (NASA Earth Science), SherAaron Hurt (The Carpentries), Jason Williams, PhD (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory), Antoinette Foster, PhD (OHSU), and BÃ¡rbara Pinheiro and Aliyah Griffith who participated in our 2023 series.

If you are a Black marine scientist and/or an HBCU student, we would love to have you! Please [register](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0ldempqDIrHtQ4KqAbr442Tm0xl4-h_dtC) and come to as many of the six events as you are able to and invite others to join you! If you are an ally, please help us amplify Black voices; we suggest allies do not sign up for this particular series.
