*`earthaccess` is Python library that simplifies data discovery and access to NASA Earthdata. On February 26, the authors co-presented at the NASA ESDS (TODO spell out acronyms in this para) Tech Spotlight meeting — to a crowd of 88 people! The author list is testament to this open community of developers: Luis Lopez, Matt Fisher and Amy Steiker are at NSIDC, Aaron Friesz is at the LP DAAC, and Qiusheng Wu is at University of Tennessee and an active open science community leader. This is a brief post to share resources and a few highlights - we encourage you to review the slides, recording, repos, and notebooks below. Additionally, please join this open science community effort via regular remote hackdays!*

### *ear*thaccess: Accelerating NASA Earthdata access through open, collaborative development

**Amy Steiker** began the presentation framing the problems that earthaccess addresses: data accessibility, API fragmentation, and authentication in the cloud.

TODO: caption, alt text

She described **earthaccess as a community**, with roots in the NASA Openscapes community where staff with similar roles supporting users across the DAACs have been able to learn, develop common tutorials, and teach together.

TODO? Maybe slide 8 or 9 screenshotted here too?

**Aaron Friesz** then shared about Earthdata Authentication - Old vs New. The old approach was 30 lines of code, where the user also had to interface with the earthdata login site. `earthaccess` now replaces this with 1 line of code. Plus, `earthaccess` also takes care of AWS credentials.

LP DAAC uses earthaccess in all of its tutorials and teaching events, including ECOSTRESS and EMIT workshops and hackathons. It has changed the way they work, develop, and teach.

Luis Lopez, `earthaccess` lead developer, then shared about **scaling in the cloud using earthaccess** from a [earthaccess and the cloud: the force awakens notebook](https://notebooksharing.space/view/48e044f22f8fd9bb18eb9dcb6d080a277dd5d1be203dd30b68a747e70c65aae7#displayOptions=). He shared how `earthaccess` interfaces between DAACs-AWS and open science community resources.

Luis demo'ed many parts of earthaccess:

-   Access remote files, automatically handling authentication and serialization.
-   Generate an on-the-fly Zarr compatible cache with Kerchunk!
-   Smart Access - Sneak peak today, *more details at SciPy 2024!*
-   Scale out workflows with Dask - [Processing Terabyte-Scale NASA Cloud Datasets with Coiled](https://blog.coiled.io/blog/processing-terabyte-scale-nasa-cloud-datasets-with-coiled.html)

Luis demo'd upcoming features in development for earthaccess that reduce egress sizes (saves NASA \$\$) and time to science! This is incredibly exciting!

```         
Egress:
 without earthaccess: 3199.29 MB 
 with earthaccess   :  112.0 MB

Time to science:
 without earthaccess: 15.9 minutes 
 with earthaccess   :  0.52 minutes
```

Qiusheng Wu then shared **`earthaccess` in action with leafmap**. Qiusheng built the \[NASA Earth Data Catalog\]() on top of \`earthaccess\`, which uses GitHub actions to pull the most recent metadata records for NASA Earthdata. Then, using leafmap — Python package for geospatial analysis and interactive mapping in a Jupyter environment that Qiusheng developed — users can interact and view the metadata on a map, exploring and selecting to find the data they want.

This is so exciting to have earthaccess involved as the 88th notebook example in the leafmap resource list! You can click to launch the notebook in different coding environments, including Google Colab.

**earthaccess has a lot of momentum moving forward as an open science community,** and we welcome you to join our bi-weekly hackdays: fostering new contributions through small group work aligning around specific topics or features. Please reach out if you are interested in joining!
