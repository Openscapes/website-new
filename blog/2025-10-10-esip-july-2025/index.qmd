*My biggest takeaways from ESIP is the power of small, interconnected open communities that can build and innovate through trust and deep expertise. Our work will continue to be a connector and supporter of people as we build. “Find people whose life paths didn’t look like yours to cross chasms together with” was a slide from Yuvi (2i2c)’s talk during our Crossing the Chasm session, and it really encapsulates so much of the vibe at the ESIP July 2025 meeting.*

## Heading H2

Julie: I came home from the ESIP summer meeting feeling proud of the building we're doing with partners in the open source science ecosystem. This ecosystem continues to expand and I continue to learn from these communities and recharge.  It was an emotional and fast-paced week, full of absolute highs of learning with dear colleagues and really crushing lows from the absence of so many federal and federally funded colleagues who were denied attendance. This included most Openscapes folks, and I came home with absolute appreciation for my colleagues – the Openscapes team, mentors, and community. 

Openscapes’ main message at ESIP was that we’re still here, and we're supporting the work. We are supporting NASA Earthdata, NOAA Fisheries, California Water Boards teams most directly, and many other groups indirectly through making all our work open source, and prioritizing storytelling, and connecting ideas and people across ecosystems. At the same time, we are checking in and adapting as we need to to support this work. 

There was a lot going on the whole week. One of the reasons we were able to step up to co-lead was because our team's and community's social infrastructure of trust and kindness is mapped on to our systems of Google docs and meetings and GitHub, and these really supported folks with cascading effects in ways we will never know.You'll see that in the earthaccess hackday FUNding Friday timeline below. 

You also see it in Eli Holmes' Crossing the Chasm talk. She and I have been iterating this talk all year with NOAA leadership audiences and I still learn something new every time Eli reflects, and I love it. She talks about social and operational chasms that prevent ideas from spreading through a population. When she participates in working groups across NOAA about Data Modernization, she hears what the policies are, what goals, and she says: “Ah, this is what the skillbuilding needs to be. This is the behavior change we need” and then turns around to do it. Using the Diffusion of Innovation theory: she thought deeply about the 13.5% of early adopters needed to cross the chasm – in 2021 we weren’t there yet. Early Adopters are a personality type. Not a skill set. They hear something and turn around and do it and then teach others. They are rare, and often shackled. Supporting them brightens them and they can contribute to real change, and that’s how we’ve [Crossed the Chasm at NOAA Fisheries](https://openscapes.org/blog/2025-05-13-cng-conf/). Hearing Yuvi then talk about finding chasms to cross, that “A group somewhere may be missing exactly just your skillset to cross a chasm” was incredibly inspiring, as was Jen’s story of stepping up when people ask for help crossing chasms.


## A peek at the sessions Openscapes co-led:  

-   **Consistent, reproducible workflows for geospatial stewardship**, with Rich Signell, Julia Lowndes, Brianna Pagán, Kate Wing, Carl Boettiger, Jed Sundwall. This session aimed to create consistent, reproducible workflows for others to learn and use. 

-   **Crossing the chasm: amplifying success stories about co-creating across institutions,** with Julie Lowndes, Eli Holmes, Jennifer Schopf, Yuvi. ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14ZSgvUbgVMrf_oD2QBIb7NBViavp2dX-Yae3WPITuKo/edit?slide=id.g34b3b339705_0_2152#slide=id.g34b3b339705_0_2152)). This session shared four stories of the Diffusion of Innovation theory in practice: at NOAA Fisheries, at NASA Earthdata, 2021-2022, at the Texas Advanced Computing Center by saving 50 years of astronomy data with Arecibo, and Finding Chasms to Cross: JupyterHubs at Scale from Wikimedia to UC Berkeley to your Research Institution. 

    -   Note: since NASA Mentors were denied attendance, we prepared a whole Community Call for them to share the following week: [earthaccess — helping users leverage the awesomeness of NASA Earthdata](https://openscapes.org/blog/2025-08-01-earthaccess-awesomeness-nasa-earthdata/)

-   **Archive your first or second data set**, with Julie Lowndes, Joseph Gum, Eli Holmes, Kate Wing, Rachael Blake. ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1na8ciQn2QROL4zEWq0q8bN0ym_3wOZS_Hzd6fBmJXnY/edit?slide=id.g37049fcd87e_3_73#slide=id.g37049fcd87e_3_73)) This was a hands-on companion session to “Case Studies of Transitioning Datasets from Specialist to Generalist Repositories”. The vision here will be to help people figure out where and how to archive their first or second data set, using Zenodo as an explicit example

 -   **Unconf** to prepare for the NASEM’s Future Directions for Earth Observations and Data Stewardship conference in December ([details & registration](https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/45531_12-2025_future-directions-for-earth-observations-and-data-stewardship-a-workshop)), with Steve Diggs, Kate Wing, Rachael Blake 

-   **FUNding Friday [pitch for an earthaccess hackday](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess/discussions/1054#discussioncomment-13916327)** - this was successful, see next!


## earthaccess hackday on Dec 15!

We are hosting an earthaccess hackday on Dec 15! This hackday is supported through the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP)’s FUNding Friday initiative, and is co-hosted by Cloud-Native Geospatial Forum (CNG) and Openscapes. Please join us! [Details & registration](https://luma.com/7hp819zp)

**Note to Stef**: shall we post our timeline notes from FUNding Friday here? It would be nice to have a url for folks to share the story. If you agree, would you combine what you like from these 2 timelines:

Join us to celebrate `earthaccess`, a python library that simplifies search and access of NASA Earth science data to a few lines of code.

We will record the presentations and post on [Openscapes YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@openscapes/videos).
