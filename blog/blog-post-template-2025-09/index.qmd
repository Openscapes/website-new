*Preamble in italics. What When Who (Example from a Champions Cohort)*

*In Fall 2024, we led 3 concurrent [Openscapes Champions](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/champions.html) Cohorts for NOAA Fisheries. These were the 13th Cohorts for NOAA Fisheries involving nearly 500 staff and affiliates! This post is a summary and celebration of some their work.*
