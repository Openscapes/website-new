## Program Overview

**This is a professional development and leadership opportunity for [CSU COAST](https://www2.calstate.edu/impact-of-the-csu/research/coast)-affiliated research groups to explore open data science practices.**

[**Openscapes**](https://openscapes.org) helps research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. This opportunity is funded by **The California State University Council on Ocean Affairs, Science & Technology** [**(COAST)**](https://www2.calstate.edu/impact-of-the-csu/research/coast), which supports marine and coastal research by CSU faculty members and students. 

**Openscapes Champions** is a cohort-based mentorship program that empowers science teams with open data science tools and grows the community of practice in the research group, institution, and beyond. This two-month remote program will help you establish shared, reproducible practices for data analysis that help make your research group more efficient and inclusive. You will participate with others from your research group as a team, as a cohort with your peers. Together, you will learn how to reframe data analysis as a collaborative effort rather than an individual burden, through exploring open data science tools and community practices (e.g. R/RStudio, GitHub). For more information and guidance about selecting your team, please visit [openscapes.org/champions](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/).
