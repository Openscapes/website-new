Please join us for a conversation with Dr. Alison Hill ([\@apreshill](https://twitter.com/apreshill)) about why we are so enthused with R Markdown, and why we think it is so transformative for scientists. We'll invite others to share their R Markdown stories and questions, whether you are curious about using R Markdown for research or have examples of how you're already using it.
