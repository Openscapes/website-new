Please join us for NASA’s Open Source Science for Data Processing and Archives Workshop on October 14 to learn about NASA's Open Science initiatives, including the Open Source Science Initiative (OSSI) and Transform to Open Science (TOPS). We're excited be presenting about [Openscapes](https://openscapes.org/approach) and the [NASA-Openscapes Framework](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io)!

From [NASA's Workshop Page](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/science-data/open-source-science-workshop): 

> Open science is a foundational objective of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (SMD). Open science is an evolving paradigm that seeks to foster greater inclusivity, diversity, and participation in the scientific process while increasing transparency and reproducibility. In December of 2019, SMD released the Strategy for Data Management and Computing for Groundbreaking Science 2019-2024, which was partially based on the feedback from the 2018 data archives meeting. This strategy aims to enable transformational open science through continuous evolution of science data and computing systems for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. We want to take this opportunity to update the community on the progress of that Strategy as well to engage with you on the next steps of the implementation of the strategy.
