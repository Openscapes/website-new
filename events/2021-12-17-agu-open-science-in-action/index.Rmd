We will be presenting an invited paper "Open Project Design: Lessons from the NASA Openscapes Framework" virtually at the 2021 American Geophysical Union (AGU) annual conference, in a session "Open Science In Action" convened by Dr. Chelle Gentemann and colleagues.

**Abstract**

Open source software is about more than code: it’s about welcoming a broadening audience to a shared vision and planning for sustainability. We’ll cover considerations for open project design focused on inclusion, community building, web presence, and technology choices, sharing strategies from the NASA Openscapes Framework as an example. The NASA Openscapes Framework (https://nasa-openscapes.github.io) is supporting scientific researchers using NASA Earthdata from Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) as they migrate workflows to the cloud. Through the Openscapes approach, which builds on collaborative open design and software from open source communities, including Mozilla, RStudio, The Carpentries, and Pangeo, we are currently working with a cross-DAAC mentor community to co-create learning resources and strengthen empathy-centered teaching practices to empower research teams through this migration to the cloud. We are focusing on building community across teams through identifying common goals and developing shared processes while also developing technical skills for contributing, review, and teaching. This session will explore open project design and lessons learned thus far through the NASA Openscapes Framework while also providing practical strategies for participants.
