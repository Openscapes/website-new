## Program overview

**This is a professional development and leadership opportunity for NOAA SEFSC research groups to explore open data science practices.**

**[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org)** is an approach for doing better science in less time[^1]. We help research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapesâ€™ mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science[^2], enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact. 

**[Openscapes Champions](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/)** is a remote-by-design mentorship program for environmental and Earth science research teams to explore open data science practices. Participants attend as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/Python, GitHub, metadata), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture. 

**This opportunity is funded and coordinated by NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center ([SEFSC](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/southeast-fisheries-science-center)).**

It is the 6th cohort with NOAA Fisheries, and builds from a 2021 cohort that had research teams across four Science Centers: Northwest, Northeast, Southeast, Alaska that was sponsored in part and coordinated by NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center ([NWFSC](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center)).

## Cohort details

**Our NMFS Cohort will meet five times over two months, on alternating Thursdays.**

* **Dates:** June 30, Jul 14, 28, Aug 11, 25, 2022
* **Times:** 1:00-2:30 pm ET 
* **Where:** remotely, via Zoom
* **Who:** Cohort of ~7 NOAA teams. We generally recommend teams of 5, although team size, composition, and extent of shared projects can vary. There are no technical requirements to participate; we expect teams to have a range of skills and responsibilities and an interest in improving shared workflows. 
* **Expected time commitment:** The minimum expected time commitment is 6hrs/month for 2 months. This includes 3 hours/month over Zoom as a full Champions Cohort, as well as teams meeting independently to further discuss topics between Cohort Calls.
