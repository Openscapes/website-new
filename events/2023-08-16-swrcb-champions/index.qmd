This is the second annual California SWRCB Openscapes Champions Cohort for the California State Water Resources Control Board ([SWRCB](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/), "Water Boards"), with the Instruction Team led by staff from the Office of Information Management and Analysis ([OIMA](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/resources/oima/)) and the Division of Water Quality ([DWQ](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/water_quality/)). Learn more about Openscapes at the Water Boards: <https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/swrcb-openscapes/>.

This is a mentorship and professional development opportunity for research teams; please see the [Cohort website](https://openscapes.github.io/2023-swrcb/), and [Openscapes Champions Program](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/) for details.

The Water Boards Champions Cohorts are "forked" from Openscapes. Read the summary blog post by 2022 co-leads Anna Holder and Corey Clatterbuck: [Adapting the Champions Program for the California Water Boards](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2022/12/02/swrcb-2022/).
