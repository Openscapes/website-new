**Pathways to Open Science** is a remote event series for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science. Led by Ileana Fenwick of [Openscapes](https://openscapes.org) in partnership with [Black in Marine Science (BIMS)](https://www.blackinmarinescience.org/) and [Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science (BWEEMS)](https://www.bweems.org/), the series will begin on January 25, 2024!

## Program Details

This remote event series will convene Black environmental and marine researcher community members with the goal of developing a mindset for Open Data Science: the tools and practices enabling reproducible, transparent, and inclusive practices for data intensive science. If you're feeling bogged down by folders full of files with names like "analysis_final_v5.xlsx" and/or like empowering others, we welcome you to join us!

**This 6-part remote event series runs on Thursdays from 5:00 - 6:30pm ET, January 25 - February 29.** Event format will alternate weekly (all virtual):

-   3 community calls: 1.5 hour calls with facilitated discussion, mini-lectures and community conversations with Black data scientists, data science leaders and students
    -   January 25, February 8, 22
-   3 coworking sessions: 1.5 hour calls structured for folks to bring their own work, their code, or questions, screenshare, and come learn a new skill with us!
    -   February 2, 16, March 2

## Register (free)    
    
[Register via Zoom](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0ldempqDIrHtQ4KqAbr442Tm0xl4-h_dtC). If you are a Black marine scientist and/or an HBCU student, we would love to have you! We hope you are able to attend all six events, however, you are welcome to join as many as you are able to. Please invite others to join you! If you are an ally, please help us amplify Black voices; we suggest allies do not sign up for this particular series.
