## Openscapes is being recognized at the "Celebration of the OSTP Year of Open Science Recognition Challenge Winners" at The White House!

Julia Lowndes and Ileana Fenwick will be representing the Openscapes Team and our community at the White House and at the [Open Science Dynamic Convergence Workshop](Open Science ‘Dynamic Convergence’ Workshop) in Washington DC September 18 -19, 2024.

This is bound to be a fun community call as Ileana and Julie interview each other to share their excitement, some anxiousness, and their experiences, underpinned by so much hard work over years. Why was Openscapes recognized? Who else was there. How did you prepare. What was your 'big ask'? What would you like to ask them?

Ileana & Julie will be attending and Julie is an invited panelist at the [Open Science Dynamic Convergence Workshop](Open Science ‘Dynamic Convergence’ Workshop) bringing together researchers, students, policymakers, funders, and other stakeholders to highlight impactful open science activities, explore collaboration opportunities, and find practical ways to speed up the global adoption of open science.
