This Cohort has completed. For details, please see the 2025 Fred Hutch Openscapes Champions [Cohort webpage](https://openscapes.github.io/2025-fred-hutch/) and [summary blog post](../../blog/2025-07-09-fred-hutch-champions-2025/): ‘Taking stock’ to support infrastructure and people at the Fred Hutch, 2025 Fred Hutch Openscapes Champions Wrap-up.

## Program overview

**This is a professional development and leadership opportunity for Fred Hutch Cancer Center research groups to explore open data science practices and strengthen collaboration and reproducibility.** The spring 2025 Champions Cohort will run from April 9th to June 4th, 2025.

[**Openscapes**](https://openscapes.org) is an approach and a movement that helps researchers and those supporting research find each other and feel empowered to conduct data-intensive science [^1],[^2]. We mentor research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative research communities. Openscapes' mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science[^3], enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.

[**Openscapes Champions**](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/) is a remote-by-design mentorship program for research teams to explore open data science practices. Participants attend as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/Python, GitHub, metadata), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture.
