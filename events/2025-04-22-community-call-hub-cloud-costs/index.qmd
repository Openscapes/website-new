The purpose of this Community Call is to share tools and processes to explore cloud costs, as well as hard figures like cost per hub, cost per user, cost per science workflow. Openscapes Director Julie Lowndes will interview our guests: Andy Teucher (Openscapes), Alex Lewandowski (NASA Alaska Satellite Facility), Yuvi Panda (2i2c). Participants will leave with new insights and we'll post a recording after the event.
