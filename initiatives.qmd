## CHAMPIONS PROGRAM

**Openscapes Champions is an open data science mentorship program for science teams.** It is a multi-month program that is designed to ignite incremental and sustainable change within research teams and beyond. It helps teams get their own work done, while building skills and community within the realities of scientists' busy schedules, varying expertise and needs.

This is our flagship program, and from 2019-2024 we have led 20 cohorts. We work with partners to coordinate cohorts of 5 to 7 research teams.

The [**Openscapes Champions Lesson Series**](https://openscapes.github.io/series) is our open source curriculum we use to teach Champions Cohorts, and you can use it too.

The Lessons Series also has details about the overall program, and what to expect. Read about the experiences of our past and current Champions cohorts on our [**blog**](blog.qmd#category=champions)!<!--- and via slides from past talks on our [media](http://localhost:7168/media.html#presentations) page--->

## NASA OPENSCAPES

**NASA Openscapes is a multi-year effort to develop a mentor community across NASA Earth science data centers to support researchers as they migrate analytical workflows to the Cloud**. We approach this work as movement building, using the concept where transformations occur from relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel that builds momentum over time.

We began in 2021, co-led by Erin Robinson of Metadata Game Changers. We are currently working with Mentors from 11 of the 12 NASA Earth science data centers.

## NMFS OPENSCAPES

**NMFS Openscapes is a 3-year effort to develop a mentor community across NOAA Fisheries science centers and offices to support NOAA Fisheries’ data, infrastructure, and workforce modernization as part of the Biden-Harris Administration's Inflation Reduction Act**. We approach this work as movement building, using the concept where transformations occur from relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel that builds momentum over time.

This work is co-led by Eli Holmes, Open Science Lead at NOAA Fisheries, also known as the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS).

## MENTORS FRAMEWORK

**The Mentors Framework is a multi-year engine for culture change within organizations.** It blends tech and community building through mentoring, coaching, facilitating, art, open source, environment, inclusion, movements, and leaders we admire.

<!---The Framework involves connecting open leaders with each other and leadership and includes regular peer-learning meetings and formal skillbuilding in teaching and coaching. --->

We began developing the Mentors Framework in 2021 through NASA Openscapes, describing this in [Robinson & Lowndes 2022](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/4560/). We have also been growing the Mentors Framework with NOAA Fisheries, the California Water Boards, and Pathways to Open Science teams and are excited to expand what we are learning with other groups.

## PATHWAYS TO OPEN SCIENCE PROGRAM

**Pathways to Open Science is an event series for Black environmental & marine researchers.** It is led by [Ileana Fenwick](team.qmd) of Openscapes in partnership with [Black in Marine Science (BIMS)](https://www.blackinmarinescience.org/) and [Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science (BWEEMS)](https://www.bweems.org/), focused on building community for the future of data-intensive science.

We launched this program in 2023 and plan to lead it annually in January-March.

## REFLECTIONS PROGRAM

**Openscapes Reflections is an open data science coaching program for researchers and those who support research.** We know many like you have been looking for a lighter-weight way to get involved or continue building habits to support yourself and your colleagues. We’ve designed the Reflections Program to meet this need; Reflections is a 3-week program modeled from leadership coaching, something now core to the Openscapes approach.

We launched this program in 2023 and plan to lead it annually in May!
