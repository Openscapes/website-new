**Pathways to Open Science is a remote event series for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science.**
:::

The Pathways program is led by [Ileana Fenwick](https://twitter.com/_ileanaf) of Openscapes in partnership with [Black in Marine Science (BIMS)](https://www.blackinmarinescience.org/) and [Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science (BWEEMS)](https://www.bweems.org/).

We launched this program in 2023 and plan to lead it annually in January-March.
