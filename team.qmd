## Incubators

[**The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)**](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) helped incubate Openscapes. It conducts transformational science focused on informing solutions that will allow people and nature to thrive. Through data synthesis, collaborations, and open science, NCEAS accelerates scientific discoveries and generates big-picture insights to help solve environmental challenges. Established in 1995, NCEAS is an independent research affiliate of the University of California at Santa Barbara with a global network and impact.

[**Mozilla**](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) helped incubate Openscapes. It believes the internet must always remain a global public resource, open and accessible to all. Its work is guided by the [Mozilla Manifesto](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/). Mozilla focuses on fueling the movement for a healthy internet by supporting a diverse group of [fellows](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/what-we-fund/fellowships-and-awards-directory/) working on key internet issues; by connecting open internet leaders at events like [MozFest](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/); by publishing critical research in the [Internet Health Report](https://internethealthreport.org/2018/); and by rallying citizens around advocacy issues that connect the well being of the internet directly to everyday life.
