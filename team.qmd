[**Julia Stewart Lowndes**](https://jules32.github.io/) is a core Openscapes team member and founding director. She is a marine ecologist working at the intersection of actionable science, data science, and open science. She earned her PhD from Stanford University in 2012 studying drivers and impacts of Humboldt squid in a changing climate. In 2018 she founded Openscapes as an open source community following her own research team’s path to better science in less time, as a Mozilla Fellow and project scientist with the Ocean Health Index at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), UC Santa Barbara.

[**Liz Neeley**](https://www.liminalcreations.com/people) is a founding partner of Liminal, a science communication collective that focuses on sensemaking. She began her career in ocean conservation, where she learned the hard way that the data don’t speak for themselves. Ever since, she has focused on helping scientists find the courage and language they need to create change within themselves, their institutions, and the world. Liz is also a co-founder of SolvingFor.org and an external advisor to the Institute for Diversity Sciences and the Aspen Institute Science & Society Program, among others. She was previously Executive Director of The Story Collider.

## Mentors

[**NASA Earthdata Mentors**](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/mentors.html#mentor-cohort) are supporting colleagues and researchers using NASA Earthdata as they migrate workflows to the Cloud.

[**NOAA Fisheries Mentors**](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/mentors.html) are supporting colleagues at NOAA Fisheries with open science practices for collaboration, particularly for shared project management and government reports.

[**Pathways to Open Science Mentors**](https://openscapes.github.io/pathways-to-open-science/) support an annual remote event series for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science. This is an ongoing collaboration with Black in Marine Science (BIMS), Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science (BWEEMS), HBCU marine science professors.

[**California Water Board / CalEPA Mentors**](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/swrcb-openscapes/contact.html) are supporting colleagues to contribute to and inform the sustainable and equitable management of natural resources and identify opportunities for conservation action.

[**The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)**](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) helped incubate Openscapes. It conducts transformational science focused on informing solutions that will allow people and nature to thrive. Through data synthesis, collaborations, and open science, NCEAS accelerates scientific discoveries and generates big-picture insights to help solve environmental challenges. Established in 1995, NCEAS is an independent research affiliate of the University of California at Santa Barbara with a global network and impact.

[**Mozilla**](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) helped incubate Openscapes. It believes the internet must always remain a global public resource, open and accessible to all. Its work is guided by the [Mozilla Manifesto](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/). Mozilla focuses on fueling the movement for a healthy internet by supporting a diverse group of [fellows](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/what-we-fund/fellowships-and-awards-directory/) working on key internet issues; by connecting open internet leaders at events like [MozFest](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/); by publishing critical research in the [Internet Health Report](https://internethealthreport.org/2018/); and by rallying citizens around advocacy issues that connect the well being of the internet directly to everyday life.
