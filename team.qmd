## Mentors

[**NASA Earthdata Mentors**](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/mentors.html#mentor-cohort) are supporting researchers using NASA Earthdata as they migrate workflows to the Cloud

[**NOAA Fisheries Mentors**](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/mentors.html) are supporting colleagues at NOAA Fisheries with open science practices for collaboration, particularly for shared project management and government reports.

[**California Water Board / CalEPA Co-leads**](https://github.com/cawaterboarddatacenter) Anna Holder and Corey Clatterbuck, both environmental scientists in the [Office of Information Management and Analysis](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/resources/oima/) and the [Surface Water Ambient Monitoring Program](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/), mentored Champions Cohorts in 2021 and began co-leading annual Champions Cohorts at the Water Boards in 2022! Regardless of her role, Anna uses ecology, data science, and science communication to contribute to and inform the sustainable and equitable management of natural resources. Anna obtained her M.S. and B.S. from CSU Monterey Bay in Applied Marine and Watershed Science. [Corey](https://www.coreyclatterbuck.com/) is an ecologist who uses data science to assess the condition of our natural resources and identify opportunities for conservation action. Corey earned her PhD from the Joint Doctoral Program in Ecology at San Diego State University and the University of California, Davis in 2021.

## Advisors & Collaborators

[**Allison Horst**](https://allisonhorst.github.io/) is a long-time Openscapes advisor and collaborator. She is a data scientist, teacher, and artist.

## Incubators

[**The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)**](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) helped incubate Openscapes. It conducts transformational science focused on informing solutions that will allow people and nature to thrive. Through data synthesis, collaborations, and open science, NCEAS accelerates scientific discoveries and generates big-picture insights to help solve environmental challenges. Established in 1995, NCEAS is an independent research affiliate of the University of California at Santa Barbara with a global network and impact.

[**Mozilla**](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) helped incubate Openscapes. It believes the internet must always remain a global public resource, open and accessible to all. Its work is guided by the [Mozilla Manifesto](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/). Mozilla focuses on fueling the movement for a healthy internet by supporting a diverse group of [fellows](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/what-we-fund/fellowships-and-awards-directory/) working on key internet issues; by connecting open internet leaders at events like [MozFest](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/); by publishing critical research in the [Internet Health Report](https://internethealthreport.org/2018/); and by rallying citizens around advocacy issues that connect the well being of the internet directly to everyday life.
